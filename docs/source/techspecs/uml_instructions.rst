Introduction
------------

UML is the instruction set used by MAME’s recompiler framework.
Front-ends translate code running on the guest CPUs to UML instructions,
and back-ends convert the UML instructions to a form that can be
executed or interpreted on the host system.

Many UML instruction have multiple instruction sizes.  Integer instructions
default to 32-bit size.  Adding a ``D`` or ``d`` prefix to the mnemonic changes
to 64-bit size (double word).  Floating point instructions use the mnemonic
prefix/suffix ``FS`` or ``fs`` for IEEE 754 32-bit format (single precision) or
or the prefix/suffix ``FD`` or ``fd`` for IEEE 754 64-bit format (double
precision).

Return from a subroutine, transferring control to the instruction
following the :ref:`CALLH <umlinst-callh>` or :ref:`EXH <umlinst-exh>`

.. _umlinst-hashjmp:

HASHJMP
~~~~~~~

Unwind all nested generated code subroutine frames and transfer control
to the location associated with the specified mode and emulated program
counter values.  If no location is associated with the specified mode
and program counter values, call the subroutine beginning at the
specified code handle.  Note that all nested generated code subroutine
frames are unwound in either case.

This is usually used to jump to the generated code corresponding to the
emulated code at a particular address when it is not known to be in the
current generated code block or when the mode changes.

    The floating point value to convert to an integer.  The instruction
    size sets the size/format of this operand.
size (access size)
    The size of the result.  Must be ``SIZE_DWORD`` (32-bit) or
    ``SIZE_QWORD`` (64-bit).  Note that this operand controls the size
    of the ``dst`` operand while the instruction size sets the size of
    the ``src`` operand.
round (rounding type)
    The rounding type to use.  Must be ``ROUND_ROUND`` (round to
    nearest), ``ROUND_CEIL`` (round toward positive infinity),
    ``ROUND_FLOOR`` (round toward negative infinity), ``ROUND_TRUNC``
    (round toward zero) or ``ROUND_DEFAULT`` (use the current default
