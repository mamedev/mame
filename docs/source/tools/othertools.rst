Other tools included with MAME
==============================


ledutil.exe/ledutil.sh
----------------------

On Microsoft Windows, ledutil.exe can take control of your keyboard LEDs to mirror those that were present on some early arcade games (e.g. Asteroids)

Start **ledutil.exe** from the command line to enable LED handling. Run **ledutil.exe -kill** to stop the handler.

On SDLMAME platforms such as Mac OS X and Linux, **ledutil.sh** can be used. Use **ledutil.sh -a** to have it automatically close when you exit SDLMAME.
