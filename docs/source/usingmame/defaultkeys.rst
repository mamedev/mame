Controls Foreword
-----------------

MAME supports a vast array of different types of machines, with a
significantly different array of inputs across them. This means that some
keyboard keys, mouse buttons, and joystick buttons will be used for multiple
functions. As a result, the control charts below are separated by machine-types
to make it easier to find what you’re looking for.

All of the controls below are fully configurable in the user interface. These
charts show the default configuration.

Note that the defaults shown here are arranged by US ANSI key positioning. If
you are using a different layout, the keys will vary.

MAME User Interface Controls
----------------------------

The controls here cover MAME functions such as MAME’s menus, machine pause,
and saving/loading save states.


**Tab**
    Toggles the configuration menu.
**`**/**~** (backtick/tilde key)
    Toggles the On-Screen Display.

    If you are running with -debug, this key sends a ‘break’ in emulation.

    When a slider control is visible, you can use the following keys to control
    it:

    * **Up** - select previous parameter to modify.
    * **Down** - select next parameter to modify.
    * **Left** - decrease the value of the selected parameter.
    * **Right** - increase the value of the selected parameter.
    * **Enter** - reset parameter value to its default.
    * **Control+Left** - decrease the value by 10x.
    * **Shift+Left** - decrease the value by 0.1x.
    * **Alt+Left** - decrease the value by the smallest amount.
    * **Control+Right** - increase the value by 10x.
    * **Shift+Right** - increase the value by 0.1x.
    * **Alt+Right** - increase the value by the smallest amount.
    * **End** - temporarily hide the On Screen Display.
    * **Home** - bring the On Screen Display back after hiding it.

    Highlight first or last UI menu option.
**[** **]**
    Move to previous or next group in UI menus that support it (e.g. move to the
    inputs for the previous or next device in the **Input Assignments (this
    System)** menu).
**Enter**/**Joystick 1 Button 1**
    Select currently highlighted UI menu option.

**F3**
    Soft resets the machine.

    scratch. This is a more thorough and complete reset than the reset you get
    from hitting F3.
**F4**
    Shows the game palette, decoded graphics tiles/characters and any tilemaps.

    Use the Enter key to switch between the three modes (palette, graphics, and
    tilemaps).

    Press F4 again to turn off the display.
    The key controls in each mode vary slightly:

      restrict to integer scale factors).

    Note: Not all systems have decoded graphics and/or tilemaps.
**Left Shift+F4**
    While paused, loads the most recent rewind save state.

**Left Shift+F5**

    will also appear in the selection menu to allow overwriting of that save
    state.
**Left Shift+F6**
    Create a quick save state.
**F7**
    Load a save state. You will be prompted to press a key or select from the
    menu to determine which save state you wish to load.

    *Note that the save state feature is not supported for a large number of
    drivers. If a given driver is not known to work perfectly, you will
    receive a warning that the save state may not be valid when attempting to
    save or load.*

    Default mapping for the **uimodekey**.

    This key toggles MAME’s response to user interface keys such as the
    (by default) **Tab** key being used for menus. All emulated machines
    which require emulated keyboards will start with UI controls disabled by
    default and you can only access the internal UI by first hitting this
    **uimodekey** key. You can change the initial status of the emulated
    keyboard as presented upon start by using

games without gambling features may also lack the Bet key.  Some games may not
use all keys that are present. For example many games do not use the Flip Flop
and Last Chance keys.
