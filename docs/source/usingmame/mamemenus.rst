MAME Menus
==========

If you started MAME without any command line parameters, you'll be shown the
system selection menu immediately. While the keys listed above will let you
navigate the menus, you can also use a mouse.

[todo: This needs SERIOUS expansion. Waiting on answer to a few questions..]
