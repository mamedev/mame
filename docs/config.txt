This file describes general usage information about MAME. It is intended
to cover aspects of using and configuring the program that are common
across operating systems. For additional OS-specific options, please see
the separate documentation for your particular version of MAME.



Using the program
-----------------

The usual way to run MAME is by telling it to run a particular game:

	mame <gamename> [options]

For example:

	mame robby -nosound

...will run Robby Roto without sound. There are many, many options 
available. All commonly supported options are listed below. Options that
are specific to one operating system or version of MAME will be listed
in a separate document.

An alternative way to run MAME is to give it a command:

	mame <command> [parameters]

For example:

	mame -listsource gridlee
	
...will print the name of the source file where the gridlee driver lives 
to the screen. There are just a handful of these commands in MAME. They 
are all listed below, just before the options list.



Default Keys
------------

All the keys below are fully configurable in the user interface. This list
shows the standard keyboard configuration.

Tab       Toggles the configuration menu.
    
~         Toggles the On Screen Display. When the on-screen display is
          visible, you can use the following keys to control it:
          
             Up - select previous parameter to modify
             Down - select next parameter to modify
             Enter - reset parameter value to its default

             Left - decrease the value of the selected parameter
             Control+Left - decrease the value by 10x
             Shift+Left - decrease the value by 0.1x
             Alt+Left - decrease the value by the smallest amount

             Right - increase the value of the selected parameter
             Control+Right - increase the value by 10x
             Shift+Right - increase the value by 0.1x
             Alt+Right - increase the value by the smallest amount
          
P         Pauses the game.

Shift+P   While paused, advances to next frame.

F1        Toggle crosshairs for games that use them. Each subsequent
          press will enable crosshairs for one more player.

F2        Service Mode for games that support it.

F3        Resets the game.

Shift+F3  Performs a "hard reset", which tears everything down and re-
          creates it from scratch. This is a more thorough and complete
          reset than an F3.

F4        Shows the game palette, decoded GFX, and any tilemaps. Use the
          Enter key to switch between the three modes (palette, graphics,
          and tilemaps). Press F4 again to turn off the display. The key
          controls in each mode vary slightly:

             * Palette/colortable mode:
                [ ] - switch between palette and colortable modes
                Up/Down - scroll up/down one line at a time
                Page Up/Page Down - scroll up/down one page at a time
                Home/End - move to top/bottom of list
                -/+ - increase/decrease the number of colors per row
                Enter - switch to graphics viewer

             * Graphics mode:
                [ ] - switch between different graphics sets
                Up/Down - scroll up/down one line at a time
                Page Up/Page Down - scroll up/down one page at a time
                Home/End - move to top/bottom of list
                Left/Right - change color displayed
                R - rotate tiles 90 degrees clockwise
                -/+ - increase/decrease the number of tiles per row
                Enter - switch to tilemap viewer

             * Tilemap mode:
                [ ] - switch between different tilemaps
                Up/Down/Left/Right - scroll 8 pixels at a time
                Shift+Up/Down/Left/Right - scroll 1 pixel at a time
                Control+Up/Down/Left/Right - scroll 64 pixels at a time
                R - rotate tilemap view 90 degrees clockwise
                -/+ - increase/decrease the zoom factor
                Enter - switch to palette/colortable mode

          Note: Not all games have decoded graphics and/or tilemaps.

F6        Toggle cheat mode (if started with "-cheat").

F7        Load a save state. You will be requested to press a key to
          determine which save state you wish to load. Note that the save
          state feature is not supported for a large number of drivers. If
          support is not enabled for a given driver, you will receive a 
          warning when attempting to save or load.

Shift+F7  Create a save state. Requires an additional keypress to identify
          the state, similar to the load option above.

F8        Decrease frame skip on the fly.

F9        Increase frame skip on the fly.

F10       Toggle speed throttling.

F11       Toggles speed display.

Shift+F11 Toggles profiler display (debug builds only).

F12       Saves a screen snapshot.

Insert    Fast forward. While held, runs the game with throttling disabled
          and with the maximum frameskip.

Escape    Exits emulator.




Core commands
-------------

-help / -h / -?

	Displays current MAME version and copyright notice.

-validate / -valid

	Performs internal validation on every driver in the system. Run this
	before submitting changes to ensure that you haven't violated any of
	the core system rules.



Configuration commands
----------------------

-createconfig / -cc

	Creates the default mame.ini file. All the configuration options
	(not commands) described below can be permanently changed by editing 
	this configuration file.

-showconfig / -sc

	Displays the current configuration settings. If you route this to a
	file, you can use it as an INI file. For example, the command:

		mame -showconfig >mame.ini

	is equivalent to -createconfig.

-showusage / -su

	Displays a summary of all the command line options. For options that
	are not mentioned here, the short summary given by "mame -showusage" 
	is usually sufficient.



Frontend commands
-----------------

Note: By default, all the '-list' commands below write info to the screen.
If you wish to write the info to a textfile instead, add this to the end 
of your command:

  > filename

...where 'filename' is the textfile's path and name 
(e.g., c:\mame\list.txt).

-listxml / -lx [<gamename|wildcard>]

	List comprehensive details for all of the supported games. The output
	is quite long, so it is usually better to redirect this into a file. 
	The output is in XML format. By default all games are listed; however,
	you can limit this list by specifying a driver name or wildcard after 
	the -listxml command.

-listfull / -ll [<gamename|wildcard>]

	Displays a list of game driver names and descriptions. By default all
	games are listed; however, you can limit this list by specifying a 
	driver name or wildcard after the -listfull command.

-listsource / -ls [<gamename|wildcard>]

	Displays a list of drivers and the names of the source files their 
	game drivers live in. Useful for finding which driver a game runs on 
	in order to fix bugs. By default all games are listed; however, you 
	can limit this list by specifying a driver name or wildcard after 
	the -listsource command.

-listclones / -lc [<gamename|wildcard>]

	Displays a list of clones. By default all clones are listed; however, 
	you can limit this list by specifying a driver name or wildcard after 
	the -listsource command.

-listcrc

	Displays a full list of CRCs of all ROM images referenced by all
	drivers within MAME.

-listroms <gamename>

	Displays a list of ROM images referenced by the specified game.

-listsamples <gamename>

	Displays a list of samples referenced by the specified game.

-verifyroms [<gamename|wildcard>]

	Checks for invalid or missing ROM images. By default all drivers that
	have valid ZIP files or directories in the rompath are verified; 
	however, you can limit this list by specifying a driver name or 
	wildcard after the -verifyroms command.

-verifysamples [<gamename|wildcard>]

	Checks for invalid or missing samples. By default all drivers that
	have valid ZIP files or directories in the samplepath are verified; 
	however, you can limit this list by specifying a driver name or 
	wildcard after the -verifyroms command.

-romident

	Attempts to identify ROM files, if they are known to MAME, in the
	specified .zip file or directory. This command can be used to try and 
	identify ROM sets taken from unknown boards. On exit, the errorlevel 
	is returned as one of the following:
	
		0: means all files were identified
		7: means all files were identified except for 1 or more "non-ROM"
			files
		8: means some files were identified
		9: means no files were identified



Configuration options
---------------------

-[no]readconfig / -[no]rc

	Enables or disables the reading of the config files. When enabled
	(which is the default), MAME reads the following config files in order:

		- mame.ini
		- <mymame>.ini (i.e. if MAME was renamed mame060.exe, MAME
				parses mame060.ini here)
		- mamed.ini  (if this is a debug build, i.e. mamed.exe)
		- vector.ini (for vector games only)
		- <driver>.ini (based on the source filename of the driver)
		- <parent>.ini (for clones only, may be called recursively)
		- <gamename>.ini

	The settings in the later ini's override those in the earlier ini's.
	So, for example, if you wanted to disable overlay effects in the
	vector games, you can create a vector.ini with the "effect none" line
	in it, and it will override whatever effect value you have in your
	mame.ini. The default is ON (-readconfig).



Core search path options
------------------------

-rompath / -rp <path>

	Specifies a list of paths within which to find ROM or hard disk images.
	Multiple paths can be specified by separating them with semicolons.
	The default is 'roms' (that is, a directory "roms" in the same directory
	as the MAME executable).

-samplepath / -sp <path>

	Specifies a list of paths within which to find sample files. Multiple 
	paths can be specified by separating them with semicolons. The default 
	is 'samples' (that is, a directory "samples" in the same directory as
	the MAME executable).

-artpath / -artwork_directory <path>

	Specifies a list of paths within which to find artwork files. Multiple 
	paths can be specified by separating them with semicolons. The default 
	is 'artwork' (that is, a directory "artwork" in the same directory as
	the MAME executable).

-ctrlrpath / -ctrlr_directory <path>

	Specifies a list of paths within which to find controller-specific
	configuration files. Multiple paths can be specified by separating 
	them with semicolons. The default is 'ctrlr' (that is, a directory 
	"ctrlr" in the same directory as the MAME executable).

-inipath <path>

	Specifies a list of paths within which to find .INI files. Multiple 
	paths can be specified by separating them with semicolons. The default 
	is '.;ini' (that is, search in the current directory first, and then
	in the directory "ini" in the same directory as the MAME executable).

-fontpath <path>

	Specifies a list of paths within which to find .BDF font files. Multiple 
	paths can be specified by separating them with semicolons. The default 
	is '.' (that is, search in the same directory as the MAME executable).



Core Output Directory Options
-----------------------------

-cfg_directory <path>

	Specifies a single directory where configuration files are stored.
	Configuration files store user configurable settings that are read at
	startup and written when MAME exits. The default is 'cfg' (that is,
	a directory "cfg" in the same directory as the MAME executable). If 
	this directory does not exist, it will be automatically created.

-nvram_directory <path>

	Specifies a single directory where NVRAM files are stored. NVRAM files
	store the contents of EEPROM and non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) for games
	which used this type of hardware. This data is read at startup and 
	written when MAME exits. The default is 'nvram' (that is, a directory 
	"nvram" in the same directory as the MAME executable). If this 
	directory does not exist, it will be automatically created.

-memcard_directory <path>

	Specifies a single directory where memory card files are stored. 
	Memory card files store the contents of removable memory cards for 
	games which used this type of hardware. This data is read and written 
	under control of the user via the "Memory Card" menu in the user 
	interface. The default is 'memcard' (that is, a directory "memcard" 
	in the same directory as the MAME executable). If this directory does 
	not exist, it will be automatically created.

-input_directory <path>

	Specifies a single directory where input recording files are stored.
	Input recordings are created via the -record option and played back 
	via the -playback option. The default is 'inp' (that is, a directory 
	"inp" in the same directory as the MAME executable). If this directory 
	does not exist, it will be automatically created.

-state_directory <path>

	Specifies a single directory where save state files are stored. Save
	state files are read and written either upon user request, or when 
	using the -autosave option. The default is 'sta' (that is, a directory 
	"sta" in the same directory as the MAME executable). If this directory 
	does not exist, it will be automatically created.

-snapshot_directory <path>

	Specifies a single directory where screen snapshots are stored, when
	requested by the user. The default is 'snap' (that is, a directory 
	"snap" in the same directory as the MAME executable). If this 
	directory does not exist, it will be automatically created.

-diff_directory <path>

	Specifies a single directory where hard drive differencing files are 
	stored. Hard drive differencing files store any data that is written
	back to a hard disk image, in order to preserve the original image. 
	The differencing files are created at startup when a game with a hard 
	disk image. The default is 'diff' (that is, a directory "diff" in the 
	same directory as the MAME executable). If this directory does not 
	exist, it will be automatically created.

-comment_directory <path>

	Specifies a single directory where debugger comment files are stored. 
	Debugger comment files are written by the debugger when comments are
	added to the disassembly for a game. The default is 'comments' (that 
	is, a directory "comments" in the same directory as the MAME 
	executable). If this directory does not exist, it will be 
	automatically created.



Core Filename Options
---------------------

-cheat_file <filename>

	Specifies the name of the cheat database file. The default is 
	'cheat.dat'.



Core state/playback options
---------------------------

-state <slot>

	Immediately after starting the specified game, will cause the save 
	state in the specified <slot> to be loaded.

-[no]autosave

	When enabled, automatically creates a save state file when exiting 
	MAME and automatically attempts to reload it when later starting MAME 
	with the same game. This only works for games that have explicitly 
	enabled save state support in their driver. The default is OFF 
	(-noautosave).

-playback / -pb <filename>

	Specifies a file from which to play back a series of game inputs. This
	feature does not work reliably for all games, but can be used to watch
	a previously recorded game session from start to finish. In order to
	make things consistent, you should only record and playback with all
	configuration (.cfg), NVRAM (.nv), and memory card files deleted. The
	default is NULL (no playback).

-record / -rec <filename>

	Specifies a file to record all input from a game session. This can be
	used to record a game session for later playback. This feature does 
	not work reliably for all games, but can be used to watch a previously 
	recorded game session from start to finish. In order to make things 
	consistent, you should only record and playback with all configuration 
	(.cfg), NVRAM (.nv), and memory card files deleted. The default is 
	NULL (no recording).

-mngwrite <filename>

	Writes each video frame to the given <filename> in MNG format, 
	producing an animation of the game session. Note that -mngwrite only 
	writes video frames; it does not save any audio data. Use -wavwrite 
	for that, and reassemble the audio/video using offline tools. The 
	default is NULL (no recording).

-wavwrite <filename>

	Writes the final mixer output to the given <filename> in WAV format, 
	producing an audio recording of the	game session. The default is 
	NULL (no recording).



Core performance options
------------------------

-[no]autoframeskip / -[no]afs

	Automatically determines the frameskip level while you're playing the
	game, adjusting it constantly in a frantic attempt to keep the game
	running at full speed. Turning this on overrides the value you have 
	set for -frameskip below. The default is OFF (-noautoframeskip).

-frameskip / -fs <level>

	Specifies the frameskip value. This is the number of frames out of
	every 12 to drop when running. For example, if you say -frameskip 2,
	then MAME will display 10 out of every 12 frames. By skipping those
	frames, you may be able to get full speed in a game that requires more
	horsepower than your computer has. The default value is -frameskip 0,
	which skips no frames.

-seconds_to_run / -str <seconds>

	This option can be used for benchmarking and automated testing. It tells 
	MAME to stop execution after a fixed number of seconds. By combining 
	this with a fixed set of other command line options, you can set up a 
	consistent environment for benchmarking MAME performance. In addition, 
	upon exit, the -str option will write a screenshot called final.png
	to the game's snapshot directory.

-[no]throttle

	Configures the default thottling setting. When throttling is on, MAME
	attempts to keep the game running at the game's intended speed. When
	throttling is off, MAME runs the game as fast as it can. Note that the
	fastest speed is more often than not limited by your graphics card,
	especially for older games. The default is ON (-throttle).

-[no]sleep

	Allows MAME to give time back to the system when running with -throttle.
	This allows other programs to have some CPU time, assuming that the
	game isn't taxing 100% of your CPU resources. This option can 
	potentially cause hiccups in performance if other demanding programs
	are running. The default is ON (-sleep).

-speed <factor>

	Changes the way MAME throttles gameplay such that the game runs at some
	multiplier of the original speed. A <factor> of 1.0 means to run the
	game at its normal speed. A <factor> of 0.5 means run at half speed,
	and a <factor> of 2.0 means run at 2x speed. Note that changing this
	value affects sound playback as well, which will scale in pitch
	accordingly. The internal resolution of the fraction is two decimal
	places, so a value of 1.002 is the same as 1.0. The default is 1.0.

-[no]refreshspeed / -[no]rs

	Allows MAME to dynamically adjust the gameplay speed such that it does
	not exceed the slowest refresh rate for any targeted monitors in your
	system. Thus, if you have a 60Hz monitor and run a game that is 
	actually designed to run at 60.6Hz, MAME will dynamically change the
	speed down to 99% in order to prevent sound hiccups or other
	undesirable side effects of running at a slower refresh rate. The
	default is OFF (-norefreshspeed).



Core rotation options
---------------------

-[no]rotate

	Rotate the game to match its normal state (horizontal/vertical). This
	ensures that both vertically and horizontally oriented games show up
	correctly without the need to rotate your monitor. If you want to keep 
	the game displaying 'raw' on the screen the way it would have in the 
	arcade, turn this option OFF. The default is ON (-rotate).

-[no]ror
-[no]rol

	Rotate the game screen to the right (clockwise) or left (counter-
	clockwise) relative to either its normal state (if -rotate is 
	specified) or its native state (if -norotate is specified). The 
	default for both of these options is OFF (-noror -norol).

-[no]flipx
-[no]flipy

	Flip (mirror) the game screen either horizontally (-flipx) or 
	vertically (-flipy). The flips are applied after the -rotate and 
	-ror/-rol options are applied. The default for both of these options 
	is OFF (-noflipx -noflipy).

-[no]autoror
-[no]autorol

	These options are designed for use with pivoting screens that only
	pivot in a single direction. If your screen only pivots clockwise,
	use -autorol to ensure that the game will fill the screen either
	horizontally or vertically in one of the directions you can handle.
	If your screen only pivots counter-clockwise, use -autoror.



Core artwork options
--------------------

-[no]artwork_crop / -[no]artcrop

	Enable cropping of artwork to the game screen area only. This works
	best with -video gdi or -video d3d, and means that vertically oriented
	games running full screen can display their artwork to the left and 
	right sides of the screen. This does not work with -video ddraw 
	because of the way the game screens are rendered and scaled after the 
	fact. This option can also be controlled via the Video Options menu in 
	the user interface. The default is OFF (-noartwork_crop).

-[no]use_backdrops / -[no]backdrop

	Enables/disables the display of backdrops. The default is ON
	(-use_backdrops).

-[no]use_overlays / -[no]overlay

	Enables/disables the display of overlays. The default is ON
	(-use_overlays).

-[no]use_bezels / -[no]bezel

	Enables/disables the display of bezels. The default is ON
	(-use_bezels).



Core screen options
-------------------

-brightness <value>

	Controls the default brightness, or black level, of the game screens. 
	This option does not affect the artwork or other parts of the display.
	Using the MAME UI, you can individually set the brightness for each 
	game screen; this option controls the initial value for all visible 
	game screens. The standard value is 1.0. Selecting lower values (down 
	to 0.1) will produce a darkened display, while selecting higher values 
	(up to 2.0) will give a brighter display. The default is 1.0.

-contrast <value>

	Controls the contrast, or white level, of the game screens. This 
	option does not affect the artwork or other parts of the display. 
	Using the MAME UI, you can individually set the contrast for each 
	game screen; this option controls the initial value for all visible 
	game screens. The standard value is 1.0. Selecting lower values (down 
	to 0.1) will produce a dimmer display, while selecting higher values 
	(up to 2.0) will give a more saturated display. The default is 1.0.

-gamma <value>

	Controls the gamma, which produces a potentially nonlinear black to
	white ramp, for the game screens. This option does not affect the 
	artwork or other parts of the display. Using the MAME UI, you can 
	individually set the gamma for each game screen; this option controls 
	the initial value for all visible game screens. The standard value is 
	1.0, which gives a linear ramp from black to white. Selecting lower 
	values (down to 0.1) will increase the nonlinearity toward black, 
	while selecting higher values (up to 3.0) will push the nonlinearity 
	toward white. The default is 1.0.

-pause_brightness <value>

	This controls the brightness level when MAME is paused. The default
	value is 0.65.



Core vector options
-------------------

-[no]antialias / -[no]aa

	Enables antialiased line rendering for vector games. The default is ON
	(-antialias).

-beam <width>

	Sets the width of the vectors. This is a scaling factor against the
	standard vector width. A value of 1.0 will keep the default vector 
	line width. Smaller values will reduce the width, and larger values 
	will increase the width. The default is 1.0.

-flicker <value>

	Simulates a vector "flicker" effect, similar to a vector monitor that
	needs adjustment. This option requires a float argument in the range 
	of 0.00 - 100.00 (0=none, 100=maximum). The default is 0.



Core sound options
------------------

-[no]sound

	Enable or disable sound altogether. The default is ON (-sound).

-samplerate <value> / -sr <value>

	Sets the audio sample rate. Smaller values (e.g. 11025) cause lower
	audio quality but faster emulation speed. Higher values (e.g. 48000)
	cause higher audio quality but slower emulation speed. The default is
	48000.

-[no]samples

	Use samples if available. The default is ON (-samples).

-volume / -vol <value>

	Sets the startup volume. It can later be changed with the user 
	interface (see Keys section). The volume is an attenuation in dB: 
	e.g., "-volume -12" will start with -12dB attenuation. The default 
	is 0.



Core input options
------------------

-ctrlr <controller>

	Enables support for special controllers. Configuration files are
	loaded from the ctrlrpath. They are in the same format as the .cfg
	files that are saved, but only control configuration data is read
	from the file. The default is NULL (no controller file).

-[no]mouse

	Controls whether or not MAME makes use of mouse controllers. When
	this is enabled, you will likely be unable to use your mouse for other
	purposes until you exit or pause the game. The default is OFF 
	(-nomouse).

-[no]joystick / -[no]joy

	Controls whether or not MAME makes use of joystick/gamepad controllers.
	When this is enabled, MAME will ask DirectInput about which 
	controllers are connected. The default is OFF (-nojoystick).

-[no]lightgun / -[no]gun

	Controls whether or not MAME makes use of lightgun controllers.
	Note that most lightguns map to the mouse, so using -lightgun and
	-mouse together may produce strange results. The default is OFF
	(-nolightgun).
	
-[no]multikeyboard / -[no]multikey

	Determines whether MAME differentiates between multiple keyboards.
	Some systems may report more than one keyboard; by default, the data
	from all of these keyboards is combined so that it looks like a single
	keyboard. Turning this option on will enable MAME to report keypresses
	on different keyboards independently. The default is OFF 
	(-nomultikeyboard).

-[no]multimouse

	Determines whether MAME differentiates between multiple mice. Some 
	systems may report more than one mouse device; by default, the data
	from all of these mice is combined so that it looks like a single
	mouse. Turning this option on will enable MAME to report mouse 
	movement and button presses on different mice independently. The 
	default is OFF (-nomultimouse).

-[no]steadykey / -[no]steady

	Some games require two or more buttons to be pressed at exactly the
	same time to make special moves. Due to limitations in the keyboard
	hardware, it can be difficult or even impossible to accomplish that
	using the standard keyboard handling. This option selects a different
	handling that makes it easier to register simultaneous button presses,
	but has the disadvantage of making controls less responsive. The
	default is OFF (-nosteadykey)

-[no]offscreen_reload / -[no]reload

	Controls whether or not MAME treats a second button input from a
	lightgun as a reload signal. In this case, MAME will report the gun's
	position as (0,MAX) with the trigger held, which is equivalent to an
	offscreen reload. This is only needed for games that required you to 
	shoot offscreen to reload, and then only if your gun does not support 
	off screen reloads. The default is OFF (-nooffscreen_reload).
	
-joystick_map <map> / -joymap <map>

	Controls how joystick values map to digital joystick controls. MAME
	accepts all joystick input from the system as analog data. For true
	analog joysticks, this needs to be mapped down to the usual 4-way or
	8-way digital joystick values. To do this, MAME divides the analog
	range into a 9x9 grid. It then takes the joystick axis position (for
	X and Y axes only), maps it to this grid, and then looks up a 
	translation from a joystick map. This parameter allows you to specify
	the map. The default is 'auto', which means that a standard 8-way,
	4-way, or 4-way diagonal map is selected automatically based on the
	input port configuration of the current game.
	
	Maps are defined as a string of numbers and characters. Since the grid
	is 9x9, there are a total of 81 characters necessary to define a
	complete map. Below is an example map for an 8-way joystick:

		777888999    Note that the numeric digits correspond to the keys
		777888999    on a numeric keypad. So '7' maps to up+left, '4' maps
		777888999    to left, '5' maps to neutral, etc. In addition to the
		444555666    numeric values, you can specify the character 's',
		444555666    which means "sticky". In this case, the value of the
		444555666    map is the same as it was the last time a non-sticky
		111222333    value was read.
		111222333
		111222333
		
	To specify the map for this parameter, you can specify a string of
	rows separated by a '.' (which indicates the end of a row), like so:
	
	    777888999.777888999.777888999.444555666.444555666.444555666.
	    111222333.111222333.111222333
	
	However, this can be reduced using several shorthands supported by the
	<map> parameter. If information about a row is missing, then it is 
	assumed that any missing data in columns 5-9 are left/right symmetric 
	with data in columns 0-4; and any missing data in colums 0-4 is 
	assumed to be copies of the previous data. The same logic applies to
	missing rows, except that up/down symmetry is assumed.
	
	By using these shorthands, the 81 character map can be simply 
	specified by this 11 character string: 7778...4445
	
	Looking at the first row, 7778 is only 4 characters long. The 5th 
	entry can't use symmetry, so it is assumed to be equal to the previous
	character '8'. The 6th character is left/right symmetric with the 4th 
	character, giving an '8'. The 7th character is left/right symmetric
	with the 3rd character, giving a '9' (which is '7' with left/right
	flipped). Eventually this gives the full 777888999 string of the row.
	
	The second and third rows are missing, so they are assumed to be 
	identical to the first row. The fourth row decodes similarly to the
	first row, producing 444555666. The fifth row is missing so it is
	assumed to be the same as the fourth.
	
	The remaining three rows are also missing, so they are assumed to be
	the up/down mirrors of the first three rows, giving three final rows
	of 111222333.

-joystick_deadzone <value> / -joy_deadzone <value> / -jdz <value>

	If you play with an analog joystick, the center can drift a little.
	joystick_deadzone tells how far along an axis you must move before the
	axis starts to change. This option expects a float in the range of
	0.0 to 1.0. Where 0 is the center of the joystick and 1 is the outer
	limit. The default is 0.3.

-joystick_saturation <value> / joy_saturation <value> / -jsat <value>

	If you play with an analog joystick, the ends can drift a little,
	and may not match in the +/- directions. joystick_saturation tells how 
	far along an axis movement change will be accepted before it reaches 
	the maximum range. This option expects a float in the range of 0.0 to 
	1.0, where 0 is the center of the joystick and 1 is the outer limit.
	The default is 0.85.



Core input automatic enable options
-----------------------------------

-paddle_device <keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun|none> / -paddle
-adstick_device <keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun|none> / -adstick
-pedal_device <keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun|none> / -pedal
-dial_device <keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun|none> / -dial
-trackball_device <keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun|none> / -trackball
-lightgun_device <keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun|none>
-positional_device <keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun|none>

	Each of these options controls autoenabling the mouse, joystick, or
	lightgun depending on the presence of a particular class of analog
	control for a particular game. For example, if you specify the option
	-paddle mouse, then any game that has a paddle control will 
	automatically enable mouse controls just as if you had explicitly 
	specified -mouse. Note that these controls override the values of 
	-[no]mouse, -[no]joystick, etc.



Debugging options
-----------------

-[no]log

	Creates a file called error.log which contains all of the internal
	log messages generated by the MAME core and game drivers. The default 
	is OFF (-nolog).

-[no]verbose / -[no]v

	Displays internal diagnostic information. This information is very 
	useful for debugging problems with your configuration. IMPORTANT: when
	reporting bugs, please run with mame -verbose and include the 
	resulting information. The default is OFF (-noverbose).

-[no]debug

	Activates the integrated debugger. This is available only if the 
	program is compiled with MAME_DEBUG defined. By default, the debugger 
	is entered by pressing the tilde (~) key during emulation. It is also
	entered immediately at startup. The default is ON (-debug).

-debugscript <filename>

	Specifies a file that contains a list of debugger commands to execute
	immediately upon startup. The default is NULL (no commands).



Core misc options
-----------------

-bios <biosname>

	Specifies the specific BIOS to use with the current game, for game
	systems that make use of a BIOS. The -listxml output will list all of
	the possible BIOS names for a game. The default is 'default'.

-[no]cheat / -[no]c

	Enables the reading of the cheat database, if present, and the Cheat
	menu in the user interface. The	default is OFF (-nocheat).

-[no]skip_gameinfo

	Forces MAME to skip displaying the game info screen. The default is 
	OFF (-noskip_gameinfo).
