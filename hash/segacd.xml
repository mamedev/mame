This is a software list for the Sega CD attachment for the Sega Genesis.

Outside of the US, the Sega CD was known as the Mega CD, and software for
both the Japanese and the European version of the hardware can be found in
their respective softlists, not in this one. A merge of the three would
probably be a good idea, though.

Much of the information in this softlist has been gathered from Sega Retro:

Currently undumped discs that are known to still exist:

TODO:

Many US-released games were also released in Brazil by Tec Toy. Though
they're still NTSC Sega CD discs, there is a possibility that these are
different in their CD structure compared to the US discs. This is a point
for further investigation.

Some discs are stamped with RE on them. Probably this indicates that
they're either revisions or re-releases of previously released games.
Investigate this further.


Due to the divided field of CD dumps available, the softlist is divided in
three parts.

The first part will be what is currently considered the most proper dumps
available for the system. Currently, this is held by redump.org dumps.
While still lacking information stored on the discs, most notably the sub-
data, its properly documented dumps combined with the offset corrected
nature of the dumps make them one of the best options available. At least
until the CHD format has been upgraded with some way of appropriating the
additional data found in other types of dumps.
See: http://redump.org/

One step down the ladder we list the old TOSEC-ISO dumps. Note that this
is not TruRip dumps, which are currently not handled well by the CHD
format due to them being CCDs, which are directly unsupported by it.
The TOSEC-ISO dumps are not offset-corrected and appear to not be updated
any more, however, at least they used a consistent dumping method and
documented their dumps.
See: http://www.tosecdev.org/

The rest are from various other sources and of very varying quality. These
should preferably always be replaced with a more documented dumping method
whenever possible.

Preferably, all of these should be replaced with a scrambled, offset-
corrected set of dumps with sub-channels intact, but first the CHD parsers
needs to be updated to support it. Contenders for this field at the time
of writing include RawDump and TruRip dumps.

	This game was developed for the Sega Mega-CD system by Domark and was released in Europe as Bloodshot.
	A stateside release never happened, but in 2003 Good Deal Games released a set of reproduction disc
	made from a prototype build of the US version of the game, titled Battle Frenzy. This is a dump from
	one of those reproduction discs.

	This game was developed for the Sega Mega-CD system by Domark and was set for release in USA
	as well as Europe. It was however never released in the States. In the 2000s, Good Deal Games
	released a set of reproduction discs based off a prototype US build. This is a dump from one
	of those reproduction discs.

	This game was developed for the Sega Mega-CD system by Sony Imagesoft and was set for release in
	January 1996. It was however scrapped before it was published. In 2001, Good Deal Games released
	a set of reproduction discs based off a prototype build. This is a dump from one of those
	reproduction discs.

	This game was developed for the Sega Mega-CD system by Cryo and was set for release in March 1995.
	It was however scrapped before it was published. In the 2000s, Good Deal Games released a set of
	reproduction discs based off a prototype build. This is a dump from one of those reproduction
	discs.
