they are present in almost every single licensed cartridge, sometimes built into another chip.
There are also several CIC clones used in unlicensed cartridges.

CIC types:

-D411 : NTSC
-F411 : NTSC and processing chip
-D413 : PAL
-F413 : PAL and processing chip

Known revisions and their timeline approximaions (W.I.P):

-[1990/36,1992/21] ⊆ t(D411)
-[1992/31,1995/03] ⊆ t(D411A)
-[1995/03,1998/43] ⊆ t(D411B)

-?                 ⊆ t(F411)  //maybe used in star fox early protoypes
-[1993/03,1994/33] ⊆ t(F411A)
-[1995/20,2000/13] ⊆ t(F411B)

-[1992/18,1992/22] ⊆ t(D413)

The software list will be divided into the following categories:
[L01] Documented prototype and demo cartridges : images from confirmed non-retail cartridges
[L02] Unconfirmed prototype and demo cartridges : roms not confirmed to exist on a non-retail cartridge at this time
[L03] Documented unlicensed cartridges : images from a confirmed unlicensed cartridges
[L04] Unconfirmed unlicensed cartridges : roms not confirmed to exist on an unlicensed cartridge at this time
[L05] Bad dumps : known bad dumps, redump needed
[L06] Perfect retail images : matching images from two or more different retail cartridges
[L07] Verified retail images : images from a single documented retail cartridge
[L08] Unconfirmed retail images : images which are not confirmed and/or not documented
Beyond that last category are the roms waiting to be classified.

<!-- most common copy protection devices used in pirate cartridges,
     thanks to d4s for these infos:

     Device A: the game program checks for the expected values after writing to this device and refuses to work if they don`t match up,
     a byte-sized value is written to $88:xxxx (or mirror thereof), then read back a byte from $80:xxxx (again, mirrored to some other places),
     the bits in the byte written are swapped around a bit, in the following order: 76543210 becomes 06712345
     - Aladdin 2000
     - Bananas de Pijamas
     - A Bug's Life
     - Digimon Adventure
     - King of Fighters 2000
     - Pocket Monster
     - Pokemon Gold Silver
     - Pokemon Stadium
     - Soul Edge Vs Samurai
     - Street Fighter EX Plus Alpha
     - X-Men vs. Street Fighter

     Device B: the game program checks for the expected values after writing to this device and refuses to work if they don`t match up,
     a byte-sized constant value is written to $88:xxxx (or mirror thereof), then read back a byte from $80:xxxx (again, mirrored to some other places),
     - Soul Blade

     Device C: the game program checks for the expected values after writing to this device and refuses to work if they don`t match up,
     it seems to contain some kind of microcontroller and expects write sequences
     details of the algorithm unknown at this time, all the values the game needs were bruteforced
     - Tekken 2
