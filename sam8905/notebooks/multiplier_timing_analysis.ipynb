    "## Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### SAM8905 Pipeline Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total pipeline latency: ~4 cycles**\n",
    "1. SRAM fetch: ~2 cycles (85ns SRAM at 35ns/cycle)\n",
    "2. Multiplication: ~2 cycles (as documented)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evidence from ALG 1 Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "When accounting for the full pipeline, all WACC instructions have **4-6 cycle gaps** from the X-setter (WPHI/WWF/WXY) whose result they actually use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The apparent \"1-cycle gaps\" we saw earlier were misleading - WACC was reading the result from an **earlier** X-setter that had completed its pipeline, not the immediately preceding one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Emulation Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "For accurate emulation, we need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **X register pipeline**: WPHI/WWF with external waveforms should update X after ~2 cycles delay\n",
    "2. **Multiplication pipeline**: mul_result should reflect X*Y from ~2 cycles ago\n",
    "\n",
    "Or equivalently, a combined 4-stage pipeline where WACC/RP read results from 4 cycles back.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Implementation Status\n",
    "\n",
    "The current \"continuous multiplication\" approach computes mul_result immediately. This may work if the algorithms are designed to always have sufficient gaps, but it's not hardware-accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For full accuracy, implement a delay pipeline:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "// Track X values through pipeline\n",
    "m_x_pipeline[3] = m_x_pipeline[2];\n",
    "m_x_pipeline[2] = m_x_pipeline[1]; \n",
    "m_x_pipeline[1] = m_x_pipeline[0];\n",
    "m_x_pipeline[0] = new_x_from_waveform;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Use pipelined X for multiplication\n",
    "m_mul_result = m_x_pipeline[2] * m_y;  // 2-cycle delayed X\n",
    "```"
