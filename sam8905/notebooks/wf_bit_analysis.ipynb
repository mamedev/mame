    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Finding:** The internal waveform bit interpretation change (swapping R and I bits) **CANNOT** be the cause of FX breaking because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FX algorithm only uses WF=0x000** (EXTERNAL mode) - the internal waveform code path is never executed\n",
    "2. **SND uses WF=0x100** (internal sinus forced by WPHI+WSP) - bits 6 and 7 are both 0, so swapping them makes no difference\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between \"corrected\" and \"swapped\" interpretations would only matter for:\n",
    "- WF=0x140 (bit 6 set)\n",
    "- WF=0x180 (bit 7 set)  \n",
    "- WF=0x1C0 (both bits set)\n",
    "\n",
    "But these values are **never used** in either SND or FX algorithms!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible Real Causes\n",
    "\n",
    "The FX issue must be caused by something else that changed. Looking at the system reminders, these changes were also made:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `m_fx_input_sample` changed from `int16_t` to `uint16_t`\n",
    "2. Sign extension logic in `sam_fx_waveform_r` changed\n",
    "3. Ring buffer / synchronization changes\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct fix likely isn't about swapping bits 6 and 7 - it's about one of these other changes."

    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FX algorithms use WF=0x000 (EXTERNAL) exclusively** - all X values come from SRAM reads\n",
    "2. **No WPHI+WSP combinations** - internal sinus mode is never forced\n",
    "3. **No D[13] access** in any of the 4 FX algorithms\n",
    "4. **All 4 FX algorithms are IDENTICAL** (same 30 instructions repeated)\n",
    "\n",
    "The WXY instructions read:\n",
    "- PC00: SRAM addr 0x0000\n",
    "- PC0A: SRAM addr 0x0A01\n",
    "- PC0E: SRAM addr 0x0804\n",
    "- PC16: SRAM addr 0x0A01\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** Since WF is always 0x000 (bits 6 and 7 both clear), swapping R and I bit positions should have **NO EFFECT** on FX!\n",
    "\n",
    "The real cause of FX breaking must be elsewhere. Possible causes:\n",
    "1. Uninitialized WF state at startup?\n",
    "2. Race condition in timing?\n",
    "3. Other code changes made alongside the bit swap?\n",
    "\n",
