README.txt - for pm_test directory

These are all test programs for PortMidi

Because device numbers depend on the system, there is no automated
script to run all tests on PortMidi.

To run the full set of tests manually:

Note: everything is run from the ../Debug or ../Release directory.
Actual or example input is marked with >>, e.g., >>0 means type 0<ENTER>
Comments are shown in square brackets [like this]

1. ./qtest -- output should show a bunch of tests and no error message.

2. ./testio [test input]

3. ./testio [test input (fail w/assert)]
Latency in ms: >>0

23. ./fast [no latency]
    ./fastrcv [in another shell]
[This is a speed check, especially for macOSX IAC bus connections,
 which are known to drop messages if you send messages too fast.
 fast and fastrcv must use a loopback to function.]

[see message counts and times; on Linux you should get about 10000 
 messages/s; on macOS you should get about 1800 messages/s; Windows 
 does not have software ports, so data rate might be limited by the 
 loopback device you use.]

Check output of fastrcv: there should be no errors, just msg/sec.]

    ./fastrcv [virtual input port, in another shell]
[In fastrcv:]
    Input device number: >>8 [enter number listed for "Create virtual 
                              port named 'fastrcv' (input)"]

29. ./midithru -v -n [virtual input and output, macOS and Linux only]
    ./fast [latency = 0]
    ./fastrcv [in another shell]
[Start midithru first, it will run for 60 seconds]
[In fastrcv:]
    Input device number: >>3 [pick the device named 
                              port named "midithru (input)"]

    sending output... 
[see message counts and times as above, on Mac, output from fast to
 midithru AND output from midithru to fastrcv are rate limited, so
 as in other tests, it will take more than 10s to receive all the
 messages and the receiving message rate will be about 1800 messages/second]

30. ./multivirtual [macOS and Linux only]
    ./testio

[In second testio:]

    Type input number: >>2  [pick portmidi2 (input) 
    Type output number: >>5  [pick portmidi2 (output)

[see that each testio gets 11 messages (0 to 10) at reasonable times
 (e.g. 2077 to 7580, and the "@" times (real times) should match the
 timestamps). multivirtual should also report reasonable times and
 line near the end of output should be "Got 11 messages from
 portmidi1 and 11 from portmidi2; expected 11."]

31. ./multivirtual [macOS and Linux only]
    ./multivirtual
[Second instance should report "PortMidi call failed...
   PortMidi: Cannot create virtual device: name is taken"]

32. pmdefaults (if built, requires Java and some CMake options)
    [must be run from pm_java/pmdefaults]
    ./testio
[In pmdefaults: 
    Select an input device. Input should flash the green
        test light.
    Select an output device. Test button should play a note.
    Save the selections.
    Quit the program.]
[In testio:]
    Latency in ms: >>0
    enter your choice... >>5 [test both]
    [In the device list, default devices are marked. They
    should match the devices selected with pmdefaults.]
