/* midithru.c -- example program implementing background thru processing */

/* suppose you want low-latency midi-thru processing, but your
   application wants to take advantage of the input buffer and
   timestamped data so that it does not have to operate with very low
   latency.

   This program illustrates how to use a timer callback from PortTime
   to implement a low-latency process that handles midi thru,
   including correctly merging midi data from the application with
   midi data from the input port.

   The main application, which runs in the main program thread, will
   use an interface similar to that of PortMidi, but since PortMidi
   does not allow concurrent threads to share access to a stream, the
   application will call private methods that transfer MIDI messages
   to and from the timer thread using lock-free queues. All PortMidi
   API calls are made from the timer thread.
 */

/* DESIGN

All setup will be done by the main thread. Then, all direct access to 
PortMidi will be handed off to the timer callback thread.

After this hand-off, the main thread will get/send messages via a queue.

The goal is to send incoming messages to the midi output while merging
any midi data generated by the application. Sysex is a problem here
because you cannot insert (merge) a midi message while a sysex is in
progress. There are at least three ways to implement midi thru with 
sysex messages:

1) Turn them off. If your application does not need them, turn them off
   with Pm_SetFilter(midi_in, PM_FILT_ACTIVE | PM_FILT_SYSEX). You will
   not receive sysex (or active sensing messages), so you will not have 
   to handle them.

2) Make them atomic. As you receive sysex messages, copy the data into
   a (big) buffer. Ideally, expand the buffer as needed -- sysex messages
   do not have any maximum length. Even more ideally, use a list structure
   and real-time memory allocation to avoid latency in the timer thread.
   When a full sysex message is received, send it to the midi output all
   at once.

3) Process sysex incrementally. Send sysex data to midi output as it
   arrives. Block any non-real-time messages from the application until
   the sysex message completes. There is the risk that an incomplete
   sysex message will block messages forever, so implement a 5-second
   timeout: if no sysex data is seen for 5 seconds, release the block,
   possibly losing the rest of the sysex message. 

   Application messages must be processed similarly: once started, a
   sysex message will block MIDI THRU processing. We will assume that
   the application will not abort a sysex message, so timeouts are not
   necessary here.

This code implements (3).

Latency is also an issue. PortMidi requires timestamps to be in 
non-decreasing order. Since we'll be operating with a low-latency
timer thread, we can just set the latency to zero meaning timestamps
are ignored by PortMidi. This will allow thru to go through with
minimal latency. The application, however, needs to use timestamps
because we assume it is high latency (the whole purpose of this
example is to illustrate how to get low-latency thru with a high-latency
application.) So the callback thread will implement midi timing by
observing timestamps. The current timestamp will be available in the
global variable current_timestamp.
