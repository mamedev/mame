/** @file pmutil.h lock-free queue for building MIDI 
                   applications with PortMidi. 

    PortMidi is not reentrant, and locks can suffer from priority
    inversion.  To support coordination between system callbacks, a
    high-priority thread created with PortTime, and the main
    application thread, PortMidi uses a lock-free, non-blocking
    queue. The queue implementation is not particular to MIDI and is
    available for other uses.

/** The queue representation is opaque. Declare a queue as PmQueue * */
typedef void PmQueue;

/** create a single-reader, single-writer queue. 

    @param num_msgs the number of messages the queue can hold

    @param the fixed message size

    @return the allocated and initialized queue, or NULL if memory
    cannot be allocated. Allocation uses #pm_malloc().

    The queue only accepts fixed sized messages. 

    This queue implementation uses the "light pipe" algorithm which
    operates correctly even with multi-processors and out-of-order
    memory writes. (see Alexander Dokumentov, "Lock-free Interprocess
    Communication," Dr. Dobbs Portal, http://www.ddj.com/,
    articleID=189401457, June 15, 2006. This algorithm requires that
    messages be translated to a form where no words contain
    zeros. Each word becomes its own "data valid" tag. Because of this
    translation, we cannot return a pointer to data still in the queue
    when the "peek" method is called. Instead, a buffer is
    preallocated so that data can be copied there. Pm_QueuePeek()
    dequeues a message into this buffer and returns a pointer to it. A
    subsequent Pm_Dequeue() will copy from this buffer.

    This implementation does not try to keep reader/writer data in
    separate cache lines or prevent thrashing on cache lines. 
    However, this algorithm differs by doing inserts/removals in
    units of messages rather than units of machine words. Some
    performance improvement might be obtained by not clearing data
    immediately after a read, but instead by waiting for the end
    of the cache line, especially if messages are smaller than
    cache lines. See the Dokumentov article for explanation.

    The algorithm is extended to handle "overflow" reporting. To
    report an overflow, the sender writes the current tail position to
    a field.  The receiver must acknowlege receipt by zeroing the
    field. The sender will not send more until the field is zeroed.

    out-of-order writes, the full message has not arrived. Therefore,

/** get a pointer to the item at the head of the queue.

    @result a pointer to the head message or NULL if the queue is empty.

    The message is not removed from the queue.  #Pm_QueuePeek() will
    not indicate when an overflow occurs. If you want to get and check
    #pmBufferOverflow messages, use the return value of
    #Pm_QueuePeek() *only* as an indication that you should call
    #Pm_Dequeue(). At the point where a direct call to #Pm_Dequeue()
    would return #pmBufferOverflow, #Pm_QueuePeek() will return NULL,
    but internally clear the #pmBufferOverflow flag, enabling
    #Pm_Enqueue() to resume enqueuing messages. A subsequent call to
    #Pm_QueuePeek() will return a pointer to the first message *after*
    the overflow.  Using this as an indication to call #Pm_Dequeue(),
    the first call to #Pm_Dequeue() will return #pmBufferOverflow. The
    second call will return success, copying the same message pointed
    to by the previous #Pm_QueuePeek().

    When to use #Pm_QueuePeek(): (1) when you need to look at the message
    data to decide who should be called to receive it. (2) when you need
    to know a message is ready but cannot accept the message.

    Note that #Pm_QueuePeek() is not a fast check, so if possible, you 
    might as well just call #Pm_Dequeue() and accept the data if it is there.
