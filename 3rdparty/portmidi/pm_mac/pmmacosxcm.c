/* Notes:

    Since the input and output streams are represented by
    MIDIEndpointRef values and almost no other state, we store the
    MIDIEndpointRef on pm_descriptors[midi->device_id].descriptor.
    
    OS X does not seem to have an error-code-to-text function, so we
    will just use text messages instead of error codes.

    Virtual device input synchronization: Once we create a virtual
    device, it is always "on" and receiving messages, but it must drop
    messages unless the device has been opened with Pm_OpenInput. To
    open, the main thread should create all the data structures, then
    call OSMemoryBarrier so that writes are observed, then set
    is_opened = TRUE.  To close without locks, we need to get the
    callback to set is_opened to FALSE before we free data structures;
    otherwise, there's a race condition where closing could delete
    structures in use by the virtual_read_callback function. We send
    8 MIDI resets (FF) in a single packet to our own port to signal
    the virtual_read_callback to close it. Then, we wait for the
    callback to recognize the "close" packet and reset is_opened.
 
    Device scanning is done when you first open an application.
    PortMIDI does not actively update the devices. Instead, you must
    Pm_Terminate() and Pm_Initialize(), basically starting over. But
    CoreMIDI does not have a way to shut down(!), and even
    MIDIClientDispose() somehow retains state (and docs say do not
    call it even if it worked). The solution, apparently, is to
    call CFRunLoopRunInMode(), which somehow updates CoreMIDI
    state.
 
    But when do we call CFRunLoopRunInMode()? I tried calling it
    in midi_in_poll() which is called when you call Pm_Read() since
    that is called often. I observed that this caused the program
    to block for as long as 50ms and fairly often for 2 or 3ms.
    What was Apple thinking? Is it really OK to design systems that
    can only function with a tricky multi-threaded, non-blocking
    priority-based solution, and then not provide a proof of concept
    or documentation? Or is Apple's design really flawed? If anyone
    at Apple reads this, please let me know -- I'm curious.
 
    But I digress... Here's the PortMidi approach: Since
    CFRunLoopRunInMode() is potentially a non-realtime operation,
    we only call it in Pm_Initialize(), where other calls to look
    up devices and device names are quite slow to begin with. Again,
    PortMidi does not actively scan for new or deleted devices, so
    if devices change, you won't see it until the next Pm_Terminate
    and Pm_Initialize.
 
    Calling CFRunLoopRunInMode() once is probably not enough. There
    might be better way, but it seems to work to just call it 100
    times and insert 20 1ms delays (in case some inter-process
    communication or synchronization is going on).
    This adds 20ms to the wall time of Pm_Initialize(), but it
    typically runs 30ms to much more (~4s), so this has little impact.

#define MAX_BYTES_PER_S 5400

/* Apple reports that packets are dropped when the MIDI bytes/sec
   exceeds 15000. This is computed by "tracking the number of MIDI
   bytes scheduled into 1-second buckets over the last six seconds and
   averaging these counts." This was confirmed in measurements
   (2021) with pm_test/fast.c and pm_test/fastrcv.c Now, in 2022, with
   macOS 12, pm_test/fast{rcv}.c show problems begin at 6000 bytes/sec.
   Previously, we set MAX_BYTES_PER_S to 14000. This is reduced to
   5400 based on testing (which shows 5700 is too high) to fix the
   packet loss problem that showed up with macOS 12.
 
   Experiments show this restriction applies to IAC bus MIDI, but not
   to hardware interfaces. (I measured 0.5 Mbps each way over USB to a
   Teensy 3.2 microcontroller implementing a USB MIDI loopback. Maybe
   it would get 1 Mbps one-way, which would make the CoreMIDI
   restriction 18x slower than USB. Maybe other USB MIDI
   implementations are faster -- USB top speed for other protocols is
   certainly higher than 1 Mbps!)

   This is apparently based on timestamps, not on real time, so we
   have to avoid constructing packets that schedule high speed output
   regardless of when writes occur. The solution is to alter
   timestamps to limit data rates.  This adds a slight time
   distortion, e.g. an 11 note chord with all notes on the same
   timestamp will be altered so that the last message is delayed by
   11 messages x 3 bytes/message / 5400 bytes/second = 6.1 ms.
   Note that this is about 2x MIDI speed, but at least 18x slower 
   than USB MIDI.
 
   Altering timestamps creates another problem, which is that a sender
   that exceeds the maximum rate can queue up an unbounded number of
   messages. With non-USB MIDI devices, you could be writing 5x faster
   to CoreMIDI than the hardware interface can send, causing an
   unbounded backlog, not to mention that the output stream will be a
   steady byte stream (e.g., one 3-byte MIDI message every 0.55 ms),
   losing any original timing or rhythm. PortMidi does not guarantee
   delivery if, over the long run, you write faster than the hardware
   can send.
   
   The LIMIT_RATE symbol, if defined (which is the default), enables
   code to modify timestamps for output to an IAC device as follows:

   Before a packet is formed, the message timestamp is set to the
   maximum of the PortMidi timestamp (converted to CoreMIDI time)
   and min_next_time. After each send, min_next_time is updated to
   the packet time + packet length * delay_per_byte, which limits
   the scheduled bytes-per-second. Also, after each packet list
   flush, min_next_time is updated to the maximum of min_next_time
   and the real time, which prevents many bytes to be scheduled in
   the past. (We could more directly just say packets are never
   scheduled in the past, but we prefer to get the current time -- a
   system call -- only when we perform the more expensive operation
   of flushing packets, so that's when we update min_next_time to
   the current real time. If we are sending a lot, we have to flush
   a lot, so the time will be updated frequently when it matters.)

   This possible adjustment to timestamps can distort accurate
   timestamps by up to 0.556 us per 3-byte MIDI message.
 
   Nothing blocks the sender from queueing up an arbitrary number of
   messages. Timestamps should be used for accurate timing by sending
   timestamped messages a little ahead of real time, not for
   scheduling an entire MIDI sequence at once!
