# File expat_config.h.in (as generated by autoheader by autoreconf) contains
# macro SIZEOF_VOID_P which is (1) not really needed by Expat as of today and
# (2) a problem to "multilib" systems with one shared installed
# /usr/include/expat_config.h for two Expats with different "void *" sizes
# installed in e.g. /usr/lib32 and /usr/lib64.  Hence we patch macro
# SIZEOF_VOID_P out of template expat_config.h.in so that configure will
# not put SIZEOF_VOID_P in the eventual expat_config.h.
