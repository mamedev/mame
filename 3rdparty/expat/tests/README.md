This directory contains the test suite for Expat.  The tests provide
general unit testing and regression coverage.  The tests are not
expected to be useful examples of Expat usage; see the
[examples](../examples) directory for that.

The Expat tests use a partial internal implementation of the
[Check](https://libcheck.github.io/check/) unit testing framework for
C.

Expat must be built and, on some platforms, installed, before the
tests can be run.
