ROLAND SOUNDCANVAS SOUND SET FOR GENERAL MIDI AND GS FORMAT

The Roland SoundCanvas Sound Set includes the necessary sounds to make a 
complete General MIDI compatible sound set.  It also includes additional 
sounds necessary to make a complete GS Format compatible sound set.

WHAT IS THE GS FORMAT?

The GS Format is a standardized set of specifications for sound sources 
that defines the manner in which multitimbral sound generating devices 
will respond to MIDI messages.  The GS Format also complies with General 
MIDI System Level 1.

The GS Format also defines a number of other details over and above the 
features of General MIDI.  These include unique specifications for sound 
and functions available for tone editing, effects, and other specifications 
concerning the manner in which sound sources will respond to MIDI messages.  
Any device that is equipped with GS Format sound sources can faithfully 
reproduce both General MIDI sound recordings and GS Format MIDI sound 
recordings.
