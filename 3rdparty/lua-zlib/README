To use this library, you need zlib, get it here:
     http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

To build this library, you can use CMake and get it here:
    http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

...or you can use GNU Make.
   make <platform>

Loading the library:

    If you built the library as a loadable package
        [local] zlib = require 'zlib'

    If you compiled the package statically into your application, call
    the function "luaopen_zlib(L)". It will create a table with the zlib
    functions and leave it on the stack.

-- zlib functions --

int major, int minor, int patch = zlib.version()

    returns numeric zlib version for the major, minor, and patch
    levels of the version dynamically linked in.

function stream = zlib.deflate([ int compression_level ], [ int window_size ])

    If no compression_level is provided uses Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION (6),
    compression level is a number from 1-9 where zlib.BEST_SPEED is 1
    and zlib.BEST_COMPRESSION is 9.

    Returns a "stream" function that compresses (or deflates) all
    strings passed in.  Specifically, use it as such:

    string deflated, bool eof, int bytes_in, int bytes_out =
            stream(string input [, 'sync' | 'full' | 'finish'])

        Takes input and deflates and returns a portion of it,
        optionally forcing a flush.

        A 'sync' flush will force all pending output to be flushed to
        the return value and the output is aligned on a byte boundary,
        so that the decompressor can get all input data available so
        far.  Flushing may degrade compression for some compression
        algorithms and so it should be used only when necessary.

        A 'full' flush will flush all output as with 'sync', and the
        compression state is reset so that decompression can restart
        from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged
        or if random access is desired. Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often
        can seriously degrade the compression. 

        A 'finish' flush will force all pending output to be processed
        and results in the stream become unusable.  Any future
        attempts to print anything other than the empty string will
        result in an error that begins with IllegalState.

        The eof result is true if 'finish' was specified, otherwise
        it is false.

        The bytes_in is how many bytes of input have been passed to
        stream, and bytes_out is the number of bytes returned in
        deflated string chunks.

function stream = zlib.inflate([int windowBits])

    Returns a "stream" function that decompresses (or inflates) all
    strings passed in.  Optionally specify a windowBits argument
    that is passed to inflateInit2(), see zlib.h for details about
    this argument.  By default, gzip header detection is done, and
    the max window size is used.

    The "stream" function should be used as such:

    string inflated, bool eof, int bytes_in, int bytes_out =
            stream(string input)

        Takes input and inflates and returns a portion of it.  If it
        detects the end of a deflation stream, then total will be the
        total number of bytes read from input and all future calls to
        stream() with a non empty string will result in an error that
        begins with IllegalState.

        No flush options are provided since the maximal amount of
        input is always processed.

        eof will be true when the input string is determined to be at
        the "end of the file".

        The bytes_in is how many bytes of input have been passed to
        stream, and bytes_out is the number of bytes returned in
        inflated string chunks.


function compute_checksum = zlib.adler32()
function compute_checksum = zlib.crc32()

    Create a new checksum computation function using either the
    adler32 or crc32 algorithms.  This resulting function should be
    used as such:

    int checksum = compute_checksum(string input |
                                    function compute_checksum)

        The compute_checksum function takes as input either a string
        that is logically getting appended to or another
        compute_checksum function that is logically getting appended.
        The result is the updated checksum.

        For example, these uses will all result in the same checksum:

            -- All in one call:
            local csum = zlib.crc32()("one two")

            -- Multiple calls:
            local compute = zlib.crc32()
            compute("one")
            assert(csum == compute(" two"))

            -- Multiple compute_checksums joined:
            local compute1, compute2 = zlib.crc32(), zlib.crc32()
            compute1("one")
            compute2(" two")
            assert(csum == compute1(compute2))
