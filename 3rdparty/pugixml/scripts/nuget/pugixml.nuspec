    <description>pugixml is a C++ XML processing library, which consists of a DOM-like interface with rich traversal/modification capabilities, an extremely fast XML parser which constructs the DOM tree from an XML file/buffer, and an XPath 1.0 implementation for complex data-driven tree queries. Full Unicode support is also available, with Unicode interface variants and conversions between different Unicode encodings (which happen automatically during parsing/saving).
pugixml is used by a lot of projects, both open-source and proprietary, for performance and easy-to-use interface.
This package contains builds for VS2013, VS2015 and VS2017, VS2019, for both statically linked and DLL CRT; you can switch the CRT linkage in Project -> Properties -> Referenced Packages -> pugixml.</description>
