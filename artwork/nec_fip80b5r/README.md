# **NEC FIP90B5R Segments** #

These segments were traced from photos of an NEC FIP80B5R display,
as used in several Ensoniq keyboards including the ESQ1, the VFX and TS families.

 The segments are numbered in order of the pins 58 .. 73 that drive
 the top row of character segments, as shown on [this scan of the Ensoniq ESQ1
 display board](http://buchty.net/ensoniq/files/schematics/esq1-display.jpg), as follows:
 
 ```
