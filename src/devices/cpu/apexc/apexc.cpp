    cpu/apexc/apexc.c: APE(X)C CPU emulation

    By Raphael Nabet

    APE(X)C (All Purpose Electronic X-ray Computer) was a computer built by Andrew D. Booth
    and others for the Birkbeck College, in London, which was used to compute cristal
    structure using X-ray diffraction.

    It was one of the APEC series of computer, which were simple electronic computers
    built in the early 1950s for various British Universities.  Known members of this series
    are:
    * APE(X)C: Birkbeck College, London (before 1953 (1951?))
    * APE(N)C: Board of Mathematical Machines, Oslo
    * APE(H)C: British Tabulating Machine Company
    * APE(R)C: British Rayon Research Association
    * UCC: University College, London (circa january 1956)
    * MAC (Magnetic Automatic Calculator): "built by Wharf Engineering Laboratories"
    (february 1955), which used some germanium diodes
    * The HEC (built by the British Tabulating Machine Company), a commercial machine sold
    in two models at least (HEC 2M and HEC 4) (before 1955)

    Generals specs:
    * 32-bit data word size (10-bit addresses): uses fixed-point, 2's complement arithmetic
    * CPU has one accumulator (A) and one register (R), plus a Control Register (this is
      what we would call an "instruction register" nowadays).  No Program Counter, each
      instruction contains the address of the next instruction (!).
    * memory is composed of 256 (maximal value only found on the UCC - APE(X)C only has
      32 tracks) circular magnetic tracks of 32 words: only 32 tracks can
      be accessed at a time (the 16 first ones, plus 16 others chosen by the programmer),
      and the rotation rate is 3750rpm (62.5 rotations per second).
    * two I/O units: tape reader and tape puncher.  A teletyper was designed to read
      specially-encoded punched tapes and print decoded text.  (See /systems/apexc.c)
    * machine code has 15 instructions (!), including add, substract, shift, multiply (!),
      test and branch, input and punch.  A so-called vector mode allow to repeat the same
      operation 32 times with 32 successive memory locations.  Note the lack of bitwise
      and/or/xor (!) .
    * 1 kIPS, although memory access times make this figure fairly theorical (drum rotation
      time: 16ms, which would allow about 60IPS when no optimization is made)
    * there is no indirect addressing whatever, although dynamic modification of opcodes (!)
      allows to simulate it...
    * a control panel allows operation and debugging of the machine.  (See /systems/apexc.c)

    Conventions:
    Bits are numbered in big-endian order, starting with 1: bit #1 is the
    MSBit, and bit #32 is the LSBit.

/*
    Machine code (reference: Booth):

    Format of a machine instruction:
bits:       1-5         6-10        11-15       16-20       21-25       26-31       32
field:      X address   X address   Y address   Y address   Function    C6          Vector
            (track)     (location)  (track)     (location)

    Meaning of fields:
    X: address of an operand, or immediate, or meaningless, depending on Function
        (When X is meaningless, it should be a duplicate of Y.  Maybe this is because
        X is unintentionnally loaded into the memory address register, and if track # is
        different, we add unneeded track switch delays (this theory is either wrong or
        incomplete, since it cannot be true for B or X))
    Y: address of the next instruction
    Function: code for the actual instruction executed
    C6: immediate value used by shift, multiply and store operations
    Vector: repeat operation 32 times (on all 32 consecutive locations of a track,
        starting with the location given by the X field)

    Function code:
    #   Mnemonic    C6      Description

    0   Stop

    2   I(y)                Input.  A 5-bit word is read from tape and loaded
                            into the 5 MSBits of R.  (These bits of R must be
                            cleared initially.)

    4   P(y)                Punch.  The 5 MSBits of R are punched onto the
                            output tape.

    6   B<(x)>=(y)          Branch.  If A<0, next instruction is fetched from @x, whereas
                            if A>=0, next instruction is fetched from @y

    8   l (y)       n       Shift left: the 64 bits of A and R are rotated left n times.
         n

    10  r (y)       64-n    Shift right: the 64 bits of A and R are shifted right n times.
         n                  The sign bit of A is duplicated.

    14  X (x)(y)    33-n    Multiply the contents of *track* x by the last n digits of the
         n                  number in R, sending the 32 MSBs to A and 31 LSBs to R

    16  +c(x)(y)            A <- (x)

    18  -c(x)(y)            A <- -(x)

    20  +(x)(y)             A <- A+(x)

    22  -(x)(y)             A <- A-(x)

    24  T(x)(y)             R <- (x)

    26  R   (x)(y)  32+n    Store first or last bits of R into (x).  The remaining bits of (x)
         1-n                are unaffected.  "The contents of R are filled with 0s or 1s
                            according as the original contents were positive or negative".
        R    (x)(y) n-1
         n-32

    28  A   (x)(y)  32+n    Same as 26, except that source is A, and the contents of A are
         1-n                not modified.

        A    (x)(y) n-1
         n-32

    30  S(x)(y)             Block Head switch.  This enables the block of heads specified
                            in x to be loaded into the working store.

    Note: Mnemonics use subscripts (!), which I tried to render the best I could.  Also,
      ">=" is actually one single character.  Last, "1-n" and "n-32" in store mnemonics
      are the actual sequences "1 *DASH* <number n>" and "<number n> *DASH* 32"
      (these are NOT formulas with substract signs).

    Note2: Short-hand notations: X stands for X  , A for A    , and R for R    .
                                               32         1-32             1-32

    Note3: Vectors instruction are notated with a subscript 'v' following the basic
      mnemonic.  For instance:

        A (x)(y), + (x)(y)
         v         v

      are the vector counterparts of A(x)(y) and +(x)(y).




    Note that the code has been presented so far as it was in 1957.  It appears that
    it was somewhat different in 1953 (Booth&Booth):

    Format of a machine instruction:
    Format for r, l, A:
bits:       1-9         10-15       16-17   18-21       22-30       31-32
field:      X address   C6          spare   Function    Y address   spare
    Format for other instructions:
bits:       1-9         10-17       18-21       22-30       31-32
field:      X address   D           Function    Y address   D (part 2)

    Meaning of fields:
    D (i.e. drum #): MSBs for the address of the X operand.  I don't know whether this feature
        was actually implemented, since it is said in Booth&Booth that the APE(X)C does
        not use this feature (it had only one drum of 16 tracks at the time, hence the 9
        address bits).

    Function code:
    #   Mnemonic    C6      Description

    1   A   (x)(y)  32+n(?) record first bits of A in (x).  The remaining bits of x
         1-n                are unaffected.

    2   +c(x)(y)            A <- (x)

    3   -c(x)(y)            A <- -(x)

    4   +(x)(y)             A <- A+(x)

    5   -(x)(y)             A <- A-(x)

    6   T(x)(y)             R <- (x)

    7   X (x)(y)            Multiply the contents of (x) by the number in R,
                            sending the 32 MSBs to A and 31 LSBs to R

    8   r (y)       64-n(?) Shift right: the 64 bits of A and R are shifted right n times.
         n                  The sign bit of A is duplicated.

    9   l (y)       n(?)    Shift left: the 64 bits of A and R are rotated left n times.
         n

    10  R   (x)(y)  32+n    record R into (x).
         1-n                "the contents of R are filled with 0s or 1s
                            according as the original contents were positive or negative".

    11  B<(x)>=(y)          Branch.  If A<0, next instruction is read from @x, whereas
                            if A>=0, next instruction is read from @y

    12  Print(y)            Punch.  Contents of A are printed.

    13  C(d+x)              branch ("switch Control") to instruction located in position
                            (D:X)

    14  Stop

    You will notice the absence of input instruction.  It seems that program and data were
    meant to be entered with a teletyper or a card reader located on the control panel.

    I don't know whether this computer really was in operation with this code.  Handle
    these info with caution.

/*
    memory interface:

    Data is exchanged on a 1-bit (!) data bus, 10-bit address bus.

    While the bus is 1-bit wide, read/write operation can only be take place on word
    (i.e. 32 bit) boundaries.  However, it is possible to store only the n first bits or
    n last bits of a word, leaving other bits in memory unaffected.

    The LSBits are transferred first, since this enables to perform bit-per-bit add and
    substract.  Otherwise, the CPU would need an additional register to store the second
    operand, and it would be probably slower, since the operation could only
    take place after all the data has been transferred.

    Memory operations are synchronous with 2 clocks found on the memory controller:
    * word clock: a pulse on each word boundary (3750rpm*32 -> 2kHz)
    * bit clock: a pulse when a bit is present on the bus (word clock * 32 -> 64kHz)

    CPU operation is synchronous with these clocks, too.  For instance, the AU does bit-per-bit
    addition and substraction with a memory operand, synchronously with bit clock,
    starting and stopping on word clock boundaries.  Similar thing with a Fetch operation.

    There is a 10-bit memory location (i.e. address) register on the memory controller.
    It is loaded with the contents of X after when instruction fetch is complete, and
    with the contents of Y when instruction execution is complete, so that the next fetch
    can be executed correctly.

    Instruction timings:

    track switch                6 (see 2.)

    vector                      12 (see 3.)


    (S and stop are missing in the table)


    Note that you must add the fetch delay (at least 1 cycle), and, when applicable, the
    operand read/write delay (at least 1 cycle).


    Notes:

    1.  The delay is applied after the store is done (from the analysis of the example
     in Booth p.52)

    2.  I guess that the memory controller needs 6 cycles to stabilize whenever track
      switching occurs, i.e. when X does not refer to the current track, and then when Y
      does not refer to the same track as X.  This matches various examples in Booth,
      although it appears that this delay is not applied when X is not read (cf cross-track
      B in Booth p. 49).
        However, and here comes the wacky part, analysis of Booth p. 55 shows that
      no additional delay is caused by an X instruction having its X operand
      on another track.  Maybe, just maybe, this is related to the fact that X does not
      need to take the word count into account, any word in track is as good as any (yet,
      this leaves the question of why this optimization could not be applied to vector
      operations unanswered).

    3.  This is an ambiguous statement.  Analysis of Booth p. 55 shows that
      an instance of an Av instruction with its destination on another track takes no more
      than 45 cycles, as follow:
        * 1 cycle for fetch
        * 6-cycle delay (at most) before write starts (-> track switch)
        * 32 memory cycles
        * 6-cycle delay (at most) after write completion (-> track switch)
      It appears that the delay associated with the vector mode is not distinguishable from
      the delay caused by track switch and even the delay associated to the Av instruction.
        Is there really a specific delay associated with the vector mode? To know this, we
      would need to see a vector instruction on the same track as its operands, which is
      unlikely to be seen (the only reasonnable application I can see is running a '+_v'
      to compute the checksum of the current track).

    4.  Example in Booth p. 76 ("20/4 A (27/27) (21/2)") seems to imply that
      when doing a store with a destination on a track other than the track where next
      instruction is located, the 1-cycle post-store delay is merged with the 6-cycle track
      switch delay.  (I assume this because there is lots of room on track 21, and if
      the delays were not merged, it should be easy to move the instruction forward
      to speed up loop execution time.
        Similarly, example in Booth p. 49-50 ("4/24 l 32 (5/31)") seems to show that
      a similar delay merge occurs when doing a shift with the next instruction located on
      another track.
