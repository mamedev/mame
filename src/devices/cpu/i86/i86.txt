intel 8086 and compatibles
--------------------------

this info is here,
to list and give some remarks on all 8086 compatible processors

excellent info in Hamarsoft's 86BUGS list
(also distributed in ralf browns interrupt list)

8086/8088
---------
20 bit address bus, 16 bit data bus and registers
many 8080 assembler sources should be compilable/reusable

8086
----
6 bytes prefetch queue

8088
----
8086 with 8 bit data bus,
prefetch queue only 4 byte, and refilled when 1 byte empty

early 8086/8088 revisions bug
-----------------------------
(copyright 1978 on package)
mov sreg, doesnot disable until next operation is executed

8086/8088
---------
"mov cs, " causes unconditional jump!
0xd6 is salc (sbb al,al) as all other intel x86-16 and -32 cpus

80C86/80C88
-----------
"mov cs, " ignored

80186/80188
-----------
integrated pic, timer and dmac entirely incompatible with 8259, 825[3,4] and 82[3,5]7
additional instructions
#BR/bound/int 5, #UD/illegal instruction/int 6, #NM/coprocessor unavailable/int 7 support
"mov cs, " ignored (likely causes int 6)
shift count anded with 0x1f

80188
-----
8bit data bus

NEC series
----------
80186 instruction set, additional nec instructions
although it is based on 80186 instruction set, some behaviours follow 8086
8080 emulation mode
"mov cs, " ignored
shift count not anded (acts like 8086)
0xd6 is xlat alias

NEC 70116 (V30)
---------------
8086 pin compatible

NEC 70108 (V20)
---------------
8088 pinout

NEC V30MX
---------
on die ems hardware
24 bit address but for ems memory!?
no 8080 emulation mode

NEC V40
-------
pinout, integrated peripherals 8259,54,37 clones at nonpc compatible addresses

NEC V50
-------
pinout, integrated peripherals as v40

NEC V33?
--------
speed optimized V30?

NEC V25/V35?
------------

NEC V25+/V35+?
--------------

NEC V60/V70
-----------
risc (misc/delux) like instruction set
v30? emulation mode (without 8080 emulation mode)

80286
-----
80186 with additional instructions but no peripherals
24 bit address bus,
protected mode selector/descriptor
idiv lower bound is 1 less (eg. -128 instead of -127)

80386 and later
---------------
not covered here

8087/80287/80387/80387sx
------------------------
mathematical coprocessors

weitek, iit variants

in 80486 coprocessor integrated
(except 80486sx and several clones)
80487: 80486 with other pinout
