    The multi-cartridge extender

    This is a somewhat mythical device which was never available for the normal
    customer, but there are reports of the existence of such a device
    in development labs or demonstrations.

    The interesting thing about this is that the OS of the console
    fully supports this multi-cartridge extender, providing a selection
    option on the screen to switch between different plugged-in
    cartridges.

    The switching is possible by decoding address lines that are reserved
    for GROM access. GROMs are accessed via four separate addresses
    9800, 9802, 9C00, 9C02. The addressing scheme looks like this:

    1001 1Wxx xxxx xxM0        W = write(1), read(0), M = address(1), data(0)

    This leaves 8 bits (256 options) which are not decoded inside the
    console. As the complete address is routed to the port, some circuit
    just needs to decode the xxx lines and turn on the respective slot.

    One catch must be considered: Some cartridges contain ROMs which are
    directly accessed and not via ports. This means that the ROMs must
    be activated according to the slot that is selected.

    Another issue: Each GROM contains an own address counter and an ID.
    According to the ID the GROM only delivers data if the address counter
    is within the ID area (0 = 0000-1fff, 1=2000-3fff ... 7=e000-ffff).
    Thus it is essential that all GROMs stay in sync with their address
    counters. We have to route all address settings to all slots and their
    GROMs, even when the slot has not been selected before. The selected
    just shows its effect when data is read. In this case, only the
    data from the selected slot will be delivered.

    This may be considered as a design flaw within the complete cartridge system
    which eventually led to TI not manufacturing that device for the broad
    market.

    Activates a slot in the multi-cartridge extender.
    Setting the slot is done by accessing the GROM ports using a
    specific address:

    slot 0:  0x9800 (0x9802, 0x9c00, 0x9c02)   : cartridge1
    slot 1:  0x9804 (0x9806, 0x9c04, 0x9c06)   : cartridge2
    ...
    slot 15: 0x983c (0x983e, 0x9c3c, 0x9c3e)   : cartridge16

    Scheme:

    1001 1Wxx xxxx xxM0 (M=mode; M=0: data, M=1: address; W=write)

    The following addresses are theoretically available, but the
    built-in OS does not use them; i.e. cartridges will not be
    included in the selection list, and their features will not be
    found by lookup, but they could be accessed directly by user
    programs.
    slot 16: 0x9840 (0x9842, 0x9c40, 0x9c42)
    ...
    slot 255:  0x9bfc (0x9bfe, 0x9ffc, 0x9ffe)

    Setting the GROM base should select one cartridge, but the ROMs in the
    CPU space must also be switched. As there is no known special mechanism
    we assume that by switching the GROM base, the ROM is automatically
    switched.

    Caution: This means that cartridges which do not have at least one
    GROM cannot be switched with this mechanism.

    We assume that the slot number is already calculated in the caller:
    slotnumber>=0 && slotnumber<=255

    NOTE: The OS will stop searching when it finds slots 1 and 2 empty.
    Interestingly, cartridge subroutines are found nevertheless, even when
    the cartridge is plugged into a higher slot.
