TODO:
    5110:
    * implement CS
    * TMS5110_CMD_TEST_TALK is only partially implemented
    5220:
    * Samples repeat over and over in the 'eprom' test mode. Needs investigation.
    * Implement a ready callback for pc interfaces
    - this will be quite a challenge since for it to be really accurate
      the whole emulation has to run in sync (lots of timers) with the
      cpu cores.
    * If a command is still executing, /READY will be kept high until the command has
      finished if the next command is written.
    * tomcat has a 5220 which is not hooked up at all

Pedantic detail from observation of real chip:
The 5200 and 5220 chips outputs the following coefficients over PROMOUT while
'idle' and not speaking, in this order:
e[0 or f] p[0] k1[0] k2[0] k3[0] k4[0] k5[f] k6[f] k7[f] k8[7] k9[7] k10[7]

Patent notes (important timing info for interpolation):
* TCycle ranges from 1 to 20, is clocked based on the clock input or RC clock
  to the chip / 4. This emulation core completely ignores TCycle, as it isn't
  very relevant.
    Every full TCycle count (i.e. overflow from 20 to 1), Subcycle is
    incremented.
* Subcycle ranges from 0 to 2, reload is 0 in SPKSLOW mode, 1 normally, and
  corresponds to whether an interpolation value is being calculated (0 or 1)
  or being written to ram (2). 0 and 1 correspond to 'A' cycles on the
  patent, while 2 corresponds to 'B' cycles.
    Every Subcycle full count (i.e. overflow from 2 to (0 or 1)), PC is
    incremented. (NOTE: if PC=12, overflow happens on the 1->2 transition,
    not 2->0; PC=12 has no B cycle.)
* PC ranges from 0 to 12, and corresponds to the parameter being interpolated
  or otherwise read from rom using PROMOUT.
  The order is:
  0 = Energy
  1 = Pitch
  2 = K1
  3 = K2
  ...
  11 = K10
  12 = nothing
    Every PC full count (i.e. overflow from 12 to 0), IP (aka "Interpolation Period")
    is incremented.
* IP (aka "Interpolation Period") ranges from 0 to 7, and corresponds with the amount
  of rightshift that the difference between current and target for a given
  parameter will have applied to it, before being added to the current
  parameter. Note that when interpolation is inhibited, only IP=0 will
  cause any change to the current values of the coefficients.
  The order is, after new frame parse (last ip was 0 before parse):
  1 = >>3 (/8)
  2 = >>3 (/8)
  3 = >>3 (/8)
  4 = >>2 (/4)
  5 = >>2 (/4)
  6 = >>1 (/2) (NOTE: the patent has an error regarding this value on one table implying it should be /4, but circuit simulation of parts of the patent shows that the /2 value is correct.)
  7 = >>1 (/2)
  0 = >>0 (/1, forcing current values to equal target values)
    Every IP full count, a new frame is parsed, but ONLY on the 0->*
    transition.
    NOTE: on TMS5220C ONLY, the datasheet IMPLIES the following:
    Upon new frame parse (end of IP=0), the IP is forced to a value depending
    on the TMS5220C-specific rate setting. For rate settings 0, 1, 2, 3, it
    will be forced to 1, 3, 5 or 7 respectively. On non-TMS5220 chips, it
    counts as expected (IP=1 follows IP=0) always.
    This means, the tms5220c with rates set to n counts IP as follows:
    (new frame parse is indicated with a #)
    Rate    IP Count
    00      7 0#1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0#1 2 3 4 5 6 7    <- non-tms5220c chips always follow this pattern
    01      7 0#3 4 5 6 7 0#3 4 5 6 7 0#3 4 5
    10      7 0#5 6 7 0#5 6 7 0#5 6 7 0#5 6 7
    11      7 0#7 0#7 0#7 0#7 0#7 0#7 0#7 0#7
    Based on the behavior tested on the CD2501ECD this is assumed to be the same for that chip as well.

Most of the following is based on figure 8c of 4,331,836, which is the
  TMS5100/TMC0280 patent, but the same information applies to the TMS52xx
  as well.

OLDP is a status flag which controls whether unvoiced or voiced excitation is
  being generated. It is latched from "P=0" at IP=7 PC=12 T=16.
  (This means that, during normal operation, between IP=7 PC=12 T16 and
  IP=0 PC=1 T17, OLDP and P=0 are the same)
"P=0" is a status flag which is set if the index value for pitch for the new
  frame being parsed (which will become the new target frame) is zero.
  It is used for determining whether interpolation of the next frame is
  inhibited or not. It is updated at IP=0 PC=1 T17. See next section.
OLDE is a status flag which is only used for determining whether
  interpolation is inhibited or not.
  It is latched from "E=0" at IP=7 PC=12 T=16.
  (This means that, during normal operation, between IP=7 PC=12 T16 and
  IP=0 PC=0 T17, OLDE and E=0 are the same)
"E=0" is a status flag which is set if the index value for energy for the new
  frame being parsed (which will become the new target frame) is zero.
  It is used for determining whether interpolation of the next frame is
  inhibited or not. It is updated at IP=0 PC=0 T17. See next section.

Interpolation is inhibited (i.e. interpolation at IP frames will not happen
  except for IP=0) under the following circumstances:
  "P=0" != "OLDP" ("P=0" = 1, and OLDP = 0; OR "P=0" = 0, and OLDP = 1)
    This means the new frame is unvoiced and the old one was voiced, or vice
    versa.
* TODO the 5100 and 5200 patents are inconsistent about the above. Trace the decaps!
  "OLDE" = 1 and "E=0" = 0
    This means the new frame is not silent, and the old frame was silent.



****Documentation of chip commands:***
    76543210  (these are in logical 7 thru 0 order with MSB (7) first; TI calls
              these bits by the opposite order, D0 thru D7, on the datasheet,
              with D0 being the MSB)

    x0x0xbcc: on 5200/5220: NOP (does nothing)
              on 5220C and CD2501ECD: Select frame length by cc, and b selects
              whether every frame is preceded by 2 bits to select the frame
              length (instead of using the value set by cc); the default (and
              after a reset command) is as if '0x00' was written, i.e. for
              frame length (200 samples) and 0 for whether the preceding 2
              bits are enabled (off)

    x001xxxx: READ BYTE (RDBY)
              Sends eight read bit commands (M0 high M1 low) to VSM and reads
              the resulting bits serially into a temporary register, which
              becomes readable as the next byte read from the tms52xx once
              ready goes active. Note the bit order of the byte read from the
              TMS52xx is BACKWARDS as compared to the actual data order as in
              the rom on the VSM chips; the read byte command of the tms5100
              reads the bits in the 'correct' order. This was IMHO a rather
              silly design decision of TI. (I (LN) asked Larry Brantingham
              about this but he wasn't involved with the TMS52xx chips, just
              the 5100); There's ASCII data in the TI 99/4 speech module VSMs
              which has the bit order reversed on purpose because of this!
    TALK STATUS must be CLEAR for this command to work; otherwise it is treated as a NOP.

    x011xxxx: READ AND BRANCH (RB)
              Sends a read and branch command (M0 high, M1 high) to force VSM
              to set its data pointer to whatever the data is at its current
              pointer location is)
    TALK STATUS must be CLEAR for this command to work; otherwise it is treated as a NOP.

    x100aaaa: LOAD ADDRESS (LA)
              Send a load address command (M0 low M1 high) to VSM with the 4
              'a' bits; Note you need to send four or five of these in
              sequence to actually specify an address to the vsm.
    TALK STATUS must be CLEAR for this command to work; otherwise it is treated as a NOP.

    x101xxxx: SPEAK (SPK)
              Begins speaking, pulling speech data from the current address
              pointer location of the VSM modules.

    x110xxxx: SPEAK EXTERNAL (SPKEXT)
              Clears the FIFO using SPKEE line, then sets TALKD (TALKST
              remains zero) until 8 bytes have been written to the FIFO, at
              which point it begins speaking, pulling data from the 16 byte
              FIFO.
    The patent implies TALK STATUS must be CLEAR for this command to work;
    otherwise it is treated as a NOP, but the decap shows that this is not
    true, and is an error on the patent diagram.

    x111xxxx: RESET (RST)
              Resets the speech synthesis core immediately, and clears the FIFO.


    Other chip differences:
    The 5220C (and CD2501ECD maybe?) are quieter due to a better dac arrangement on die which allows less crossover between bits, based on the decap differences.


***MAME Driver specific notes:***

    Victory's initial audio selftest is pretty brutal to the FIFO: it sends a
    sequence of bytes to the FIFO and checks the status bits after each one; if
    even one bit is in the wrong state (i.e. speech starts one byte too early or
    late), the test fails!
    The sample in Victory 'Shields up!' after you activate shields, the 'up' part
    of the sample is missing the STOP frame at the end of it; this causes the
    speech core to run out of bits to parse from the FIFO, cutting the sample off
    by one frame. This appears to be an original game code bug.

Progress list for drivers using old vs new interface:
starwars: uses new interface (couriersud)
gauntlet: uses new interface (couriersud)
atarisy1: uses new interface (Lord Nightmare)
atarisy2: uses new interface (Lord Nightmare)
atarijsa: uses new interface (Lord Nightmare)
firefox: uses new interface (couriersud)
mhavoc: uses old interface, and is in the machine file instead of the driver.
monymony/jackrabt(zaccaria.c): uses new interface (couriersud)
victory(audio/exidy.c): uses new interface (couriersud)
looping: uses old interface
portraits: uses *NO* interface; the i/o cpu hasn't been hooked to anything!
dotron and midwayfb(mcr.c): uses old interface


As for which games used which chips:

TMS5200 AKA TMC0285 AKA CD2501E: (1980 to 1983)
    Arcade: Zaccaria's 'money money' and 'jack rabbit'; Bally/Midway's
'Discs of Tron' (all environmental cabs and a few upright cabs; the code
exists on all versions for the speech though, and upright cabs can be
upgraded to add it by hacking on a 'Squawk & Talk' pinball speech board
(which is also TMS5200 based) with a few modded components)
    Pinball: All Bally/Midway machines which uses the 'Squawk & Talk' board.
    Home computer: TI 99/4 PHP1500 Speech module (along with two VSM
serial chips); Street Electronics Corp.'s Apple II 'Echo 2' Speech
synthesizer (early cards only)

EFO90503: (1982, EFO Sound-3 board used in a few Playmatic/Cidelsa games)
    Arcade: Clean Octopus
    Pinball: Cerberus, Spain '82

CD2501ECD: (1983)
    Home computer: TI 99/8 (prototypes only)

TMS5220: (mostly on things made between 1981 and 1984-1985)
    Arcade: Bally/Midway's 'NFL Football'; Atari's 'Star Wars',
'Firefox', 'Return of the Jedi', 'Road Runner', 'The Empire Strikes
Back' (all verified with schematics); Venture Line's 'Looping' and 'Sky
Bumper' (need verify for both); Olympia's 'Portraits' (need verify);
Exidy's 'Victory' and 'Victor Banana' (need verify for both)
    Pinball: Several (don't know names offhand, have not checked schematics; likely Zaccaria's 'Farfalla')
    Home computer: Street Electronics Corp.'s Apple II 'Echo 2' Speech
synthesizer (later cards only); Texas Instruments' 'Speak and Learn'
scanner wand unit; HP 27201A Speech Output Module (serial port connection).

TMS5220C AKA TSP5220C: (on stuff made from 1984 to 1992 or so)
    Arcade: Atari's 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', '720',
'Gauntlet', 'Gauntlet II', 'A.P.B.', 'Paperboy', 'RoadBlasters',
'Vindicators Pt II'(verify?), and 'Escape from the Planet of the Robot
Monsters' (all verified except for vindicators pt 2)
    Pinball: Several (less common than the tms5220? (not sure about
this), mostly on later pinballs with LPC speech)
    Home computer: Street Electronics Corp.'s 'ECHO' parallel/hobbyist
module (6511 based), IBM PS/2 Speech adapter (parallel port connection
device), PES Speech adapter (serial port connection)

Street electronics had two later 1988-1990-era ECHO appleII cards which are
TSP50c0x/1x MCU based speech and not tms52xx based (though it is likely
emulating the tms5220 in MCU code). Look for a 16-pin chip at U6 labeled
"ECHO-2 SN" or "ECHO-3 SN".

     update_fifo_status_and_ints -- check to see if the various flags should be on or off
     Description of flags, and their position in the status register:
      From the data sheet:
        bit D0(bit 7) = TS - Talk Status is active (high) when the VSP is processing speech data.
                Talk Status goes active at the initiation of a Speak command or after nine
                bytes of data are loaded into the FIFO following a Speak External command. It
                goes inactive (low) when the stop code (Energy=1111) is processed, or
                immediately by a buffer empty condition or a reset command.
        bit D1(bit 6) = BL - Buffer Low is active (high) when the FIFO buffer is more than half empty.
                Buffer Low is set when the "Last-In" byte is shifted down past the half-full
                boundary of the stack. Buffer Low is cleared when data is loaded to the stack
                so that the "Last-In" byte lies above the half-full boundary and becomes the
                eighth data byte of the stack.
        bit D2(bit 5) = BE - Buffer Empty is active (high) when the FIFO buffer has run out of data
                while executing a Speak External command. Buffer Empty is set when the last bit
                of the "Last-In" byte is shifted out to the Synthesis Section. This causes
                Talk Status to be cleared. Speech is terminated at some abnormal point and the
                Speak External command execution is terminated.
