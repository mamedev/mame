    Drivers: ti99_224 - 24 KiB version
             ti99_232 - 32 KiB version

    Codenamed "Ground Squirrel", the TI-99/2 was designed to be an extremely
    low-cost, downstripped version of the TI-99/4A, competing with systems
    like the ZX81 or the Times/Sinclair 1000. The targeted price was below $100.

    The 99/2 was equipped with a TMS9995, the same CPU as used in the envisioned
    flag ship 99/8 and later in the Geneve 9640. In the 99/2 it is clocked
    at 10.7 MHz. Also, the CPU has on-chip RAM, unlike the version in the 99/8.

    At many places, the tight price constraint shows up.
    - 2 or 4 KiB of RAM
    - Video memory is part of the CPU RAM
    - Video controller is black/white only and has a fixed character set, no sprites
    - No sound
    - No GROMs (as the significant TI technology circuit)
    - No P-Box connection

    Main board
    ----------
    1 CPU @ 10.7 MHz (contrary to specs which state 5.35 MHz)
    2 RAM circuits   (4 KiB instead of 2 KiB in specs)
    3 or 4 EPROMs
    1 TAL-004 custom gate array as the video controller
    1 TAL-004 custom gate array as the I/O controller
    and six selector or latch circuits

    Connectors
    ----------
    - Built-in RF modulator, switch allows for setting the channel to VHF 3 or 4
    - Two jacks for cassette input and output, no motor control
    - Hexbus connector
    - System expansion slot for cartridges (ROM or RAM), 60 pins, on the back

    Keyboard: 48 keys, no Alpha Lock, two separate Shift keys, additional break key.

    Description
    -----------
    Prototypes were developed in 1983. Despite a late marketing campaign,
    including well-known faces, no devices were ever sold. A few of them
    survived in the hands of the engineers, and were later sold to private
    users.

    The Ground Squirrel underwent several design changes. In the initial
    design, only 2 KiB RAM were planned, and the included ROM was 24 KiB.
    Later, the 2 KiB were obviously expanded to 4 KiB, while the ROM remained
    the same in size. This can be proved here, since the console crashes with
    less than 4 KiB by an unmapped memory access. Also, the CPU is not clocked
    by 5.35 MHz as specified, but by the undivided 10.7 MHz; this was proved
    by running test programs on the real consoles.

    The next version showed an additional 8 KiB of ROM. Possibly in order
    to avoid taking away too much address space, two EPROMs are mapped to the
    same address space block, selectable by a CRU bit. ROM may be added as
    cartridges to be plugged into the expansion slot, and the same is true
    for RAM. Actually, since the complete bus is available on that connector,
    almost any kind of peripheral device could be added. Too bad, none were
    developed.

    However, the Hexbus seemed to have matured in the meantime, which became
    the standard peripheral bus system for the TI-99/8, and for smaller
    systems like the CC-40 and the TI-74. The TI-99/2 also offers a Hexbus
    interface so that any kind of Hexbus device can be connected, like, for
    example, the HX5102 floppy drive, a Wafertape drive, or the RS232 serial
    interface. The 24K version seems to have no proper Hexbus support for
    floppy drives; it always starts the cassette I/O instead.

    The address space layout looks like this:

    0000 - 3FFF:    ROM, unbanked
    4000 - 5FFF:    ROM, banked for 32K version
    6000 - DFFF:    ROM or RAM; ROM growing upwards, RAM growing downwards
    E000 - EFFF:    4K RAM
      EC00 - EEFF:  Area used by video controller (24 rows, 32 columns)
      EF00       :  Control byte for colors (black/white) for backdrop/border
    EF01 - EFFF:    RAM
    F000 - F0FB:    CPU-internal RAM
    F0FC - FFF9:    empty
    FFFA - FFFF:    CPU-internal decrementer and NMI vector

    RAM expansions may be offered via the cartridge port, but they must be
    contiguous with the built-in RAM, which means that it must grow
    downwards from E000. The space from F0FC up to FFF9 may also be covered
    by expansion RAM.

    From the other side, ROM or other memory-mapped devices may occupy
    address space, growing up from 6000.

    One peculiar detail is the memory-mapped video RAM. The video controller
    shares an area of RAM with the CPU. To avoid congestion, the video
    controller must HOLD the CPU while it accesses the video RAM area.

    This decreases processing speed of the CPU, of course. For that reason,
    a special character may be placed in every row after which the row will
    be filled with blank pixels, and the CPU will be released early. This
    means that with a screen full of characters, the processing speed is
    definitely slower than with a clear screen.

    To be able to temporarily get full CPU power, there is a pin VIDENA at
    the video controller which causes the screen to be blank when asserted,
    and to be restored as before when cleared. This is used during cassette
    transfer.

    Technical details
    -----------------
    - HOLD is asserted in every scanline when characters are drawn that are
      not the "Blank End of line" (BEOL). Once encountered, the remaining
      scanline remains blank.
    - During cassette transfer, the screen is blanked using the VIDENA line.
      This is expected and not a bug.
    - When a frame has been completed, the INT4 interrupt of the 9995 is
      triggered as a vblank interrupt.
    - All CRU operations are handled by the second gate array. Unfortunately,
      there is no known documentation about this circuit.
    - The two banks of the last 16 KiB of ROM are selected with the same
      line that is used for selecting keyboard row 0. This should mean that
      you cannot read the keyboard from the second ROM bank.

    I/O map (CRU map)
    -----------------
    0000 - 1DFE: unmapped
    1E00 - 1EFE: TMS9995-internal CRU addresses
    1F00 - 1FD8: unmapped
    1FDA:        TMS9995 MID flag
    1FDC - 1FFF: unmapped
    2000 - DFFE: unmapped
    E000 - E00E: Read: Keyboard column input
    E000 - E00A: Write: Keyboard row selection
    E00C:        Write: unmapped
    E00E:        Write: Video enable (VIDENA)
    E010 - E7FE: Mirrors of the above
    E800 - E80C: Hexbus
       E800 - E806: Data lines
       E808: HSK line
       E80A: BAV line
       E80C: Inhibit (Write only)
    E80E: Cassette

    ROM dumps
    ---------
    Although these machines are extremely rare, we were lucky to get in
    contact with users of both console variants and got dumps from
    their machines.

    The ROMs contain a stripped-down version of TI BASIC, but without
    the specific graphics subprograms. Programs written on the 99/2 should
    run on the 99/4A, but the opposite is not true. The 24K version is
    buggy and incomplete: OPEN and SAVE cause the CPU to restart itself.

    Original implementation: Raphael Nabet; December 1999, 2000
