// this mapping was found by measuring a real TC0060DCA hybrid with a RPi, Signal Generator and a scope. 
// Test signal was a 1v peak to peak 1kHz sine wave. I've no info on frequency response, but it's likely to be flat to 20kHz.
// The measured curve fits the equation 1.0/(1.0+exp(-10*((x/256.0)-0.6))) more or less perfectly. 
// values 0 and 255 are manually set to 0 and 1.0 respectively to avoid any possible rounding errors.
