Capcom System 1
===============

Driver provided by:
Paul Leaman (paul@vortexcomputing.demon.co.uk)

68000 for game, Z80, YM-2151 and OKIM6295 for sound.

68000 clock speeds are unknown for all games (except where commented)

todo: move the bootleg sets with modified hardware into their own
      drivers, like capcom/fcrash.cpp


Notes
-----
- Most of the original PALs are protected. The images loaded in the ROM definitions are
  mostly logically equivalent replacements with a GAL16V8 target. The actual pld types
  found on the boards can also be PAL16P8, PAL16L8 etc.

- There are five PALs on the A-Board, they are the same across all A-Board
  revisions, but their location varies.
  The A-Boards are interchangeable, so the IC locations are not specified in
  the ROM definitions and are listed here instead:

  PAL ID  88617A  89626A
  ------  ------  ------
  PRG1    12H     9K
  IOA1    12F     4A
  BUF1    16H     13K
  ROM1    15H     14K
  SOU1    13E     10F

  For Q-Sound games, the A-Board misses the Z80, Oki and amp, which are replaced
  by the D-Board; the SOU1 PAL is missing as well, while PRG1 is replaced by
  PRG2. The other PALs are the same.

- The BPRG1 PAL found on later B-boards allows the use of a larger program ROM space.

- The B-board usually has two PALs (later revisions have three). The first PAL
  is used to map tile codes to the graphics ROMs, and changes from game to game.
  The other doesn't change from game to game and there are only two versions,
  called LWIO and IOB1, which are almost identical, the only difference being
  that outputs o16 and o17 are R/W in IOB1 and Write only in LWIO. Since those
  outputs are not used anyway except that in Forgotten Worlds, one wonders why
  they were changed.

  SF2 revision "E" World and USA 910228 maps CPS-B at 8001C0 instead of 800140
  and seems to be the only one that uses the IOB2 and C632B PALs instead of the
  IOB1 and C632, while STF29 PAL is confirmed to be the same as the other SF2 sets.

- The C-board ioc1 has been dumped from an unprotected pal16l8 device.

Stephh's notes (based on the games M68000 code and some tests) :

1) 'forgottn' and clones

  - Keys in the "scroll 1 test" screen :
      * P1 UP    : char code += 0x0200
      * P1 DOWN  : char code -= 0x0200
      * P1 RIGHT : attribute ^= 0x20 ; also affects Hflip
      * P1 LEFT  : attribute ^= 0x40 ; also affects Vflip
      * P1 button 1 : (attribute++) & 0x1f ; also affects color
      * P1 button 2 : (attribute--) & 0x1f ; also affects color

2) 'ghouls' and clones

2a) 'ghouls'

  - NO debug features

2b) 'ghoulsu'

  - How to activate the debug features :
      * set "Game Mode" Dip Switch to "Game"
      * set both "Coin A" and "Coin B" Dip Switches to 1C_1C
      * reset the game (F3 key)
      * insert a coin
      * set "Game Mode" Dip Switch to "Test"
      * set the debug Dip Switches to what you want
      * start a 1 player game
  - Some debug features :
      * "Armor on New Life" is effective at the beginning of a new life
        Note that even when you start without armor, you need to be hit twice
      * "Starting Weapon" is effective only when you start a new game
        or when you continue play
      * "Starting Level" is effective only when you start a new game
        (you must NOT continue play !)
      * "Slow Motion" and "Invulnerability" can be changed at any time

2c) 'daimakai'

  - NO debug features
  - Different Dip Switches than in 'ghouls'

3) 'strider' and clones

  - TO DO !

4) 'dynwar' and clones

4a) 'dynwar'

  - According to code at 0x0125fa and 0x012634, bits 0 and 1 of DSWC also affect the energy cost
    (table at 0x012662) when you press button 3 ("tactics" in the manual) :

    bit 0  bit 1    cost         possible BCD values (based on kind of "tactics")
     OFF    OFF     normal       0x10 (rockslide) 0x08 (ambush) 0x14 (flame) 0x12 (explosion)
     ON     OFF     very low     0x03             0x02          0x05         0x04
     OFF    ON      low          0x06             0x04          0x10         0x08
     ON     ON      high         0x13             0x10          0x19         0x16

    So IMO, there might be an ingame bug at 0x000c7e which should read bits 2 and 3 of DSWC
    (instead of having them unused) :
    000C7E: 0240 0003                andi.w  #$3, D0
    should be
    000C7E: 0240 000c                andi.w  #$c, D0
    However, only bits 4 to 7 are tested while you are in the "test mode".

    Note that code at 0x000c7e is only executed once when you reset the machine;
    this means that you can change the "Freeze" and "Turbo Mode" Dip Switches before
    reseting the game to change the energy cost settings, then put them back to "Off"
    after the startup routine (when screen is black) so you can play the game.
  - Both "Coin A" and "Coin B" Dip Switches must be set to "2 Coins/1 Credit" to make
    this mode available. If only one Dip Switch is set to it, it is the same as 2C_1C.

4b) 'dynwarj'

  - The "energy cost" bug also exists in this version as well as code at 0x000c7e;
    in fact, only code that reads these settings is at a different address :
    check code at 0x01267a and 0x0126b4 and table at 0x0126e2.
  - Both "Coin A" and "Coin B" Dip Switches must be set to "2 Coins/1 Credit" to make
    this mode available. If only one Dip Switch is set to it, it is the same as 2C_1C.

5) 'willow' and clones

  - How to activate the debug features :
      * set "Game Mode" Dip Switch to "Game"
      * set both "Coin A" and "Coin B" Dip Switches to 1C_1C
      * reset the game (F3 key)
      * insert a coin
      * set "Game Mode" Dip Switch to "Test"
      * set the debug Dip Switches to what you want
      * start a 1 player game
  - Some debug features :
      * "Starting Level" is effective only when you start a new game
        (you must NOT continue play !)
      * Once you set "Maximum magic/sword power" to "On", setting it to "Off" won't have
        any effect until you start a new game (you must NOT continue play !)
      * "Slow Motion Delay" is effective only when "Slow Motion" is set to "On"
      * Even if "Freeze" Dip Switch is set to "On" a message will be displayed to its end.
      * I can't tell what kind of infos are displayed when "Display Debug Infos"
        Dip Switch is sry to "On" :( Any hint about them are welcome !
  - Both "Coin A" and "Coin B" Dip Switches must be set to "2 Coins/1 Credit" to make
    this mode available. If only one Dip Switch is set to it, it is the same as 2C_1C.
  - When the "Stage Magic Continue" Dip Switch is set to "On", your magic and sword power
    will be increased at the end of the level if you haven't bought the magic/sword item.
    But you won't notice this before you use the character again.
    For example, magic power will be increased at the end of level 1 but you won't notice
    it before level 3, and sword power will be increased at the end of level 2 but you
    won't notice it before level 4.

6) 'ganbare'

  - Using the payout setting dip switch results in some occasional hopper errors, if this
    happens, then the clear ram dip switch needs to be used. This needs to be resolved.

TO DO (2006.09.20) :

  - Check 'strider' and its clones and add debug features
  - Check other games to see if there are some debug or hidden features
  - Add addresses from routines with debug features in the notes
  - Look at what IN2 and IN3 do for the following sets :
      * 'cworld2j' (IN2 only)
      * 'qad' and 'qadjr'
      * 'qtono2j'
  - Check daimakar dip switches. E.g. changing the number of lives also changes the
    starting level.

Stephh's log (2006.09.20) :

  - Changed the "readinputport" reads by "readinputportbytag" reads.
    This way, inputs and Dip Switch can be in any order
    (and I don't have the nasty conditional Dip Switch bug).
    BTW, I've slightly changed the read memory map :
      * one handler for the 3 Dip Switches banks : cps1_dsw_r
      * one handler for the system inputs (IN0) : cps1_in0_r
      * one handler for the player inputs (IN1) : cps1_in1_r
      * renamed cps1_input2_r to cps_in2_r
      * renamed cps1_input3_r to cps_in3_r
  - Applied these changes to src/drivers/fcrash.c as well.
  - Added debug features in the following sets :
      * 'ghoulsu'
      * 'willowu', 'willowou' and 'willowj'
  - Checked sets with no debug features :
      * 'forgottnua' and 'lostwrld'
      * 'ghouls' and 'daimakai'
      * 'dynwar' and 'dynwarj'

2008-07:
  - replaced input read handler with direct AM_READ_PORT where suitable

/* According to code at 0x001c4e ('mtwins') or ('chikij') , ALL bits 0 to 5 of DSWA
   must be ON to have "2 Coins/1 Credit (1 to continue)" for both coin slots.
   But according to routine starting at 0x06b27c ('mtwins') or 0x06b4fa ('chikij'),
   bit 6 of DSWA is tested to have the same "feature" in the "test mode".

   Bits 3 and 4 of DSWB affect the number of lives AND the level of damage when you get hit.
   When bit 5 of DSWB is ON you ALWAYS have 1 life but more energy (0x38 instead of 0x20).
   Useful addresses to know :
     - 0xff147b.b : lives  (player 1)
     - 0xff153b.b : lives  (player 2)
     - 0xff14ab.w : energy (player 1)

   These ROMs read from a dead and very unique top board. All EPROMs are type 27C1000, except LW_00.13C which is a 27C512.
   There are 5 surface mounted ROMs each on it's own small 88621B-sub satellite board, type HN62404FP-18 package is QFP44.
   The ROMs on the satellite boards are named and located as follows:

   LW-02 @ 6B
   LW-05 @ 6D (instead of LW_17.5C, LW_18.5E, LW_19.7C & LW_20.7E as above)
   LW-08 @ 9B
   LW-06 @ 9D
   LW-07 @ 10G

   Also known to have LW-13 @ 10D instead of LW_25.10C, LW_26.10E, LW_27.11C & LW_28.11E

   OTHER:
   2 PALs labeled LW621 (near LW_1.2A) and LWI0 (near LW_00.13C)

/*
    05/13/92 MSTREET-6

    There are quite a few variations of this board. The main differences seem to be the amount and size of roms around the 68k.
    Some variations have an additional "patch" rom and palce or gal that patches various chunks of code over the main program roms.
    This adds the usual "rainbow edition" style gameplay hacks, such as air fireballs, change character mid-game, etc.
    The boards can be run without the patch rom by removing it and the pal/gal and linking pins 1-19, 2-18, 11-16 of the empty gal socket.
    (There is also a jumper that can be soldered instead for the third connection.)

    Luckily one of my boards has an unprotected gal so I was able to decode the rom patching:

    patch rom            program space
    --------------------------------------
    0x00000-0x07fff  ->  0x000000-0x007fff
    0x08000-0x27fff  ->  0x030000-0x04ffff
    0x28000-0x37fff  ->  0x170000-0x17ffff

    Gfx:
    There are six 8Mbit roms which match the official sf2ce set almost exactly (7 bytes diff in one rom).
    There are also another two 2Mbit roms which contain very near identical data.
    Not sure why the bootleg hardware needs this or how it should be represented in emulation.
    There is also a 512Kbit rom that's purpose is unknown (possibly related to priority according to notes in other bootleg sets).

    Sound:
    YM2151 is clone marked "KA51".
    YM3012 is clone marked "KA12".
    MSM6295 is clone marked "TD735".

    Other:
    All roms have nonsense markings such as KM418C256, KM416C256 etc.
    Obviously they are not Samsung soj/tsop FPM DRAMs ;)
    Main clock is 10MHz, rather than usual 12MHZ for champion edition.
    Sets b and c:
      Turbo mode on SW(C):1.
      Press start to change character mid-game. (bug: screen goes dark when changing character, happens in attract mode as well).

    MSTREET-6 repair info:
    Frequent cause of dead board is u104 (gal/palce20v8) becoming corrupted somehow. Luckily a working unsecured chip was found and dumped :)
    Likely to also work on other similar boards (reference number may vary).

    B/C sets patch pals have different equations but are logically equivalent.

/* An interesting single board bootleg which is an almost exact replica of the official Pang3 A/B board circuitry condensed onto a single pcb.
   All component refs match the official 89626A short 10MHz A board and 94916-10 pang3 exclusive B board.
   Uses pin compatible clone CPS-A/B chips which are marked 27C634 and 27C633 respectively, the clone B is a CPS-B-17.
   They appear to be 3.3v chips as the common bootlegger trick of stepping down the supply voltage with power diodes is used.
   Main code has been hacked to use the CPS-B-17 rather than official CPS-B-21 config.
   All PALs confirmed to match official A/B board PALs.
   Uses same encryption and mach215 security pld as official.

/* This bootleg uses a bootlegged B board nearly identical to that used in sf2ceblp.
   In my set:
     - Board-A is missing so I don't know if a normal or a dash board was used.
     - Board-C is an hacked 88622-C-5 with an unusual CPS-B-12 and clearly it's not its C-board because
       code analysis led to identify the CPS_B_21_DEF as the right configuration.
     - Board-B has some missing components:
      - audio cpu code EPROM @B13 (pang3b pa3_11.11f used instead)
      - 28 pin DIP component @F8, probably a PIC16C55/7 looking the pinout (VCC on pin2, GND on pin 4, ...)

   The program code is almost the same as of pang3b with some minor, yet interesting, hacks:
      - Dip switch use for board configuration (code@ 0x000300, 0xe0000) instead of a serial EPROM
      - Removed freeze from dip switch (code@ 020B74)
      - Some code to handle the PIC (protection?).
        Read and write to addresses 0x5762b0 and 0x57a2b0 occurs in the code but the return value is never really used (nop or bra skips relevant parts)
        and so seems that the PIC protection is ineffective.
      - Read and write to port 0x80017a (EEPROM in pang3) still are present in the code, but are filtered by the PAL16V8 @ E13 so there is no need to
        create a port for that address here in mame (although this causes a popmessage "CPS-B read port 3A contact MAMEDEV" to occur at startup if compiled with
        DEBUG=1)

   Board-B has five PALs:
      - PALCE16V8  @A2
      - PAL16L8    @E11
      - PALCE16V8  @E13
      - PAL16L8    @J8
      - PALCE22V10 @J8

/*
    A note regarding bootlegs:
    In order to keep the cps source in some sort of order, the idea is to group similar bootleg hardware into separate
    derived classes and source files.

    Rom swaps, hacks etc.  (on original Capcom hardware)  ->  cps1.cpp
    Sound: Z80, 2x YM2203, 2x m5205 ("Final Crash" h/w)   ->  fcrash.cpp
    Sound: Z80, 1x YM2151, 2x m5205                       ->  cps1bl_5205.cpp
    Sound: PIC, 1x M6295            *1                    ->  cps1bl_pic.cpp
    Sound: Z80, 1x YM2151, 1x M6295 *2                    ->  fcrash.cpp      (for now...)

    *1 these seem to be only CPS1.5/Q sound games?
    *2 this is original configuration, but non-Capcom (usually single-board) hardware.


    This file currently contains games in first and last categories.
    Eventually only official/genuine/non-bootleg Capcom-hardware games and those in first category will remain here.
