/******************************************************************************

"Zeebo", or "Genie" or "Longcheer W800", is a video game developed in a partnership
between Qualcomm and Zeebo Inc., the North American arm of the Brazilian company Tectoy.

A large amount of information can be found on
https://www.tripleoxygen.net/wiki/console/zeebo/start

----

Zeebo comes equipped with an ARM11 processor running at 528 MHZ. It is a chip
with low energy consumption and widely used in smartphones, such as the iPhone 3G.

Its graphics core is called Adreno 130, and was developed by Qualcomm with technology
from ATI.

----

System was launched in 2009, but discontinued shortly after.

Games were downloaded to NAND, but once the online store was closed the games could
no longer be downloaded, leaving no way to get them back onto the system after
doing a factory restore or similar.

----

The information from the site above should be transferred into the driver, there
are details such as the memory map, and dumps of RAM from a running system.

Is there a bootstrap ROM, or does this happen transparently to the CPU? how is
memory configuration determined by default etc?

This driver needs a proper owner.
