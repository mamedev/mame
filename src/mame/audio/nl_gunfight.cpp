// This is a netlist description for the sound circuits of Midway's Gun Fight,
// based on Midway's schematic "Gun Fight Sound Generator Detail P.C.
// 597-907E".
//
// (This sound circuitry seems to have evolved from that for an older Midway
// game, an electromechanical rifle game from 1974 called Twin Pirate Gun. The
// schematics for Twin Pirate Gun's sound circuitry (P.C. 569-907-88),
// although not completely identical to Gun Fight's, are similar both in
// general structure and in many details.)
//
// Gun Fight's sound effects are simple "bang" sounds, both for the shooting
// of bullets and for bullets hitting targets. The effects are directed to the
// left or right speaker, depending on whether the left or right player is
// shooting or being hit. (Hits to obstacles get the same sound as hits to the
// right player and thus play from the right speaker.) Each sound effect gets
// a different pitch, with shots being higher pitched than hits. Shot sounds
// also decay faster than hit sounds and have slightly separated initial and
// secondary attacks, resulting in a "ka-pow" effect.
//
// The sounds are generated in stages by different sections of the circuitry.
// A noise generator, based on a zener diode, continuously produces white
// noise that forms the basis for all the sounds, and this noise is fed to
// four separate sound generators. Each generator filters the noise to produce
// the distinct pitch of its sound. Each generator's sound is triggered by a
// switch, activated digitally by the CPU. When this switch is turned on
// momentarily, a storage capacitor is charged up, and that sends power to the
// sound generator's transistor amplifier. This amplifies the filtered noise
// with a sharp attack as the switch is turned on and gradual decay as the
// capacitor drains. The generated sound is filtered further and then
// attenuated by a potentiometer which controls that sound's relative volume.
// Each side's two sound effect signals, after being generated and then
// attenuated by their respective volume pots, are mixed together and then
// further amplified by a second-stage transistor amplifier for that side.
// This mixed and amplified signal is itself filtered and then attenuated by
// the side's master volume potentiometer. Finally it gets sent to the power
// amplifier IC for that side's speaker. (This emulation does not handle the
// final power amplification.)
//
// The different sound effect generators have a common structure which is
// repeated four times. The mixers and second-stage amplifiers likewise have a
// common structure which is repeated twice, and their amplifiers are also
// rather similar to the effect amplifiers.
//
// To make the netlist easier to follow and verify, I've grouped its
// components and connections by function, with the groups ordered roughly
// according to the flow of signals:
//
// * the activating switches,
// * the shared noise generator,
// * the sound-effect noise filters,
// * the sound-effect initial amplifiers, output coupling capacitors and
//   filters, and effect-volume potentiometers,
// * the mixing circuits,
// * the second-stage amplifiers, output coupling capacitors and filters, and
//   master-volume potentiometers.
//
// Within each group, I've placed the sets of four similar components or
// connections together and listed them in the order: left-shot, right-shot,
// left-hit, right-hit. (For mixing and second-stage amplification components,
// the order is simply left, right.) Individual components are labeled the
// same as on the schematic.


// There are some uncertainties in this emulation about sound levels. The
// average level of the initially generated noise is uncertain, which poses a
// problem because all of the sound effects are based on amplifying that
// noise. The noise is generated by passing a small amount of current through
// a zener diode on the verge of its breakdown voltage, which results in very
// noisy current flow. Even though both the type of zener and the average
// current are known, the average strength of the noise is still uncertain,
// both because zener manufacturers do not specify performance under these
// conditions (they recommended zeners for voltage control under more stable,
// relatively noise-free operating conditions) and because the amount of noise
// may vary greatly from one zener to the next, even within the same
// production batch--let alone from one manufacturer to another. This is an
// inherent problem with zener diodes when used for noise generation.
//
// I have chosen a round figure of 2 mV RMS for the zener's average (RMS)
// noise level. Although this is only a guess, it seems to be in the ballpark
// for similar zeners operated with similar amounts of average current. It
// also keeps the noise component of the sound effects strong enough so as not
// to be overwhelmed by the pulse of the sound effects' initial attacks; this
// pulse is created by switching on their generating amplifiers and is
// independent of noise level. Meanwhile, this noise level is still low enough
// that, with all the volume potentiometers set to their midpoints, the noise
// won't be clipped by any subsequent amplification stage in the netlist, up
// to the power amp inputs. (Some such clipping may occur if a sound effect's
// volume is turned up well beyond its midpoint. That may also be true on real
// hardware.)
//
// The other big uncertainty is the audible effect of the power amp ICs. These
// amplifiers add both power and voltage gain, which may be enough to distort
// or clip the output. They may also have an audible filtering effect. In the
// Gun Fight schematic, and apparently in real machines, they are configured
// for a voltage gain of 15. Furthermore, any input voltages beyond a few
// hundred mV (positive or negative) should produce at least some clipping
// distortion, with the distortion getting worse for stronger signals. With
// all potentiometers set to the midpoint, the power amp signal inputs should
// see extreme pulses of +/- 3 V from the initial attack for sound effects,
// and even past those initial attack pulses, the sound effect noise should
// kick in at levels above +/- 1 V on the power amp inputs. If these levels
// are correct and the power amp ICs work as described, the noise of the sound
// effects should initially be heavily distorted, but since the original
// signal is already random noise, it's not clear whether that distortion
// would be apparent. Anyhow, the power amp ICs are completely unemulated
// here, and any distortion effects they might produce would be quite
// different from the hard clipping produced when limiting output levels
// digitally.
//
// I have compromized by setting the volume multipliers for the netlist stream
// outputs so that output levels of +/- 3 volts will produce the maximum
// allowed stream output magnitudes of +/- 32767. Voltages beyond that will be
// clipped. This at least produces some distortion if the volume
// potentiometers are adjusted above their midpoints.
//
// Further improving accuracy would require testing signal levels on actual
// hardware, with allowances made for variations in components, as well as a
// better understanding of the electrical and sonic behavior of the power
// amplifiers, speakers, and cabinet. It's questionable whether doing so is
// worth the effort.


// As I've said, this netlist does not include the final stage of sound
// generation, the twin audio power amplifier ICs. Although it is the norm for
// MAME analog sound emulation to omit this stage, some discussion of the
// power amplifiers is worthwhile in this case. Each is an SGS-ATES
// TAA-621-A11 single-channel amplifier, driving one 8-ohm speaker of about 4
// or 5 inches.
//
// (On the Gun Fight schematic, the TAA-621-A11 is also labeled "LM354". The
// TAA-621-A11 was introduced in 1970 by the Italian firm SGS. The very
// similar LM354 was introduced in 1972 by European Electronic Products.
// However, this company seems to have been a mere U.S. importer and
// distributor of European components, making the LM354 just a rebadged
// TAA-621-A11. The LM354 occasionally comes up in discussions of Gun Fight
// audio but seems to have been otherwise short-lived. One problem with its
// name is that it can easily be mistaken for a National Semiconductor LMxxx
// linear IC, even though it's unrelated to that company. To further confuse
// matters, National Semiconductor had already introduced an LM354 of their
// own in 1970 which wasn't an audio amplifier at all, but a second-source
// version of Texas Instruments' SN7525 sense amplifier for minicomputer
// magnetic-core memory systems.)
//
// As is normal for TAA-621-A11 amps, those in Gun Fight are configured with
// some negative feedback to control their voltage gain. The gain is
// determined by the ratio of the chip's internal 15-kohm feedback resistor to
// the external resistor connected to the feedback terminal, pin 10. In Gun
// Fight this external resistor is 1 kohm, so the ratio, and thus the voltage
// gain, is 15.
//
// The TAA-621-A11 is rated at 4 watts at 10% total harmonic distortion (THD)
// when supplied with 24-volt power and driving a 16-ohm load. (Although not
// explicitly stated, this appears to be an RMS rating rather than a peak
// rating.) In Gun Fight's case, the speaker load is only 8 ohms, and the
// power supply voltage is a bit lower, about 22 volts (it comes from
// rectified 16.5-volt-RMS AC, buffered by a large smoothing capacitor). Both
// of these factors lower the power rating somewhat. Also, a power rating at
// 10% THD implies clipping is already heavy. The unclipped, clean power
// rating in Gun Fight would be lower, probably no more than 2 watts RMS,
// giving output around 4 volts RMS or about 5.5 volts in extreme amplitude.
// With a power amp voltage gain of 15, this would mean that any input signals
// with extreme amplitudes greater than about a third of a volt would be
// subject to power amp clipping.
//
// The power amps also have a few other connections, including ripple bypass
// capacitors to suppress ripple from the unregulated power supply, frequency
// compensation capacitors to prevent inducing unstable amplifier oscillations
// at high frequencies, and some filtering on the output to the speakers.


// All of the amplifying transistors in this circuit are NPN transistors of a
// particular type, marked as "A-138" on the Gun Fight schematics. This seems
// to be the Amperex A-138, a low-power silicon NPN transistor made by Amperex
// Electronic Corporation, which was a U.S. division of Philips. This
// transistor, being a vendor-specific type long out of production, seems to
// have fallen into obscurity. The only source I could find with any data on
// it (given in greatly abbreviated form) is _Transistor Discontinued Devices
// D.A.T.A.Book, Edition 16_ (1980), by Derivation and Tabulation Associates,
// which lists the A-138 on p. 76, line 86.
//
// This source shows the A-138 to be an ordinary amplifier transistor of
// fairly high gain, with a maximum small-signal forward current transfer
// ratio (h_fe, AC current gain) of 650. The minimum h_fe is not given, but it
// can be estimated using the fact that such transistors are often graded and
// designated by gain. The A-137, another Amperex transistor listed on line 85
// of the same D.A.T.A.Book page, has the same limits on power, collector
// current, and junction voltages, and thus appears to be in the same series,
// but it has a maximum h_fe of 415. If the A-137 was the next lower grade of
// gain from the A-138, the latter should have a minimum h_fe around 400.
// Values for h_FE, the DC forward current transfer ratio (DC current gain),
// aren't given for the A-138, but the range would be about the same or a bit
// lower, perhaps 350-600, with an average around 450-500.
//
// The high gain of Gun Fight's A-138 transistors causes a "ka-pow" effect in
// its shot sounds; I explain how later. (Andy Wellburn, in a Discord chat on
// 2020-06-05, confirmed this effect can be heard in some actual machines. He
// measured an h_FE of 238 for one A-138 from a Gun Fight sound board, but he
// warned that for old transistors like this, h_FE measurements can vary a
// lot, and I'm not surprised that the transistors' gain might be reduced more
// than 40 years later. But even a gain of 238 turns out to be high enough to
// give the "ka-pow" shot effect.)
//
// Considering the A-138's high gain and other limits, a decent match for it
// here seems to be the BC548C, which is modeled in the netlist library. The
// BC548C is the high-gain version of the BC548, a widely used Pro Electron
// standard type of general-purpose small-signal transistor in a through-hole
// TO-92 package. All A-138 transistors in this netlist are modeled as
// BC548Cs.

	// **** Sound effect activation switches.

	// These switches are triggered by digital logic signals activated by
	// the CPU. A high TTL logic level turns the switch on, allowing
	// 16-volt power to flow through the switch into the sound effect
	// generator's amplifier and storage capacitor, and a low logic level
	// turns the switch off, cutting off the power flow. In practice, each
	// sound effect is triggered by turning its switch on for about 50 ms
	// and then switching it off again.
	//
	// Each switch is built from two transistors: a "low-side" NPN
	// transistor which is switched on when a high TTL output level drives
	// the NPN's base high, and a "high-side" PNP transistor which is
	// switched on when the now conducting NPN pulls the PNP's base low.
	// It is the high-side PNP transistor that actually switches the
	// 16-volt power, hence the term "high-side".

	// **** Shared white-noise generator circuit. This is the basic noise
	// **** source which is filtered and amplified by the sound-effect
	// **** circuits.

	// Gun Fight's noise generator circuit is based on a reverse-biased
	// 9.1-volt zener diode (D304, a 1N5239) whose noise current is then
	// amplified by an A-138 NPN transistor, producing white noise at
	// audio frequencies.
	//
	// (Strictly speaking, this is not a *pure* white noise generator,
	// because the generator's bypass capacitor and biasing resistor, in
	// combination with negative feedback from the amplified signal, act
	// as a high-pass RC filter, filtering out the lowest noise
	// frequencies.)
	//
	// Figuring out how strong the noise signal should be for this circuit
	// is difficult. The noise generator's biasing resistors and
	// transistor gain limit the average current through its zener to
	// around 2 microamps, but the 1N5239 is normally expected to be used
	// with much larger currents, in the range of 250 microamps to 50
	// milliamps.
	//
	// Zeners are most often used for smoothly controlling and limiting
	// voltage with minimal fluctuation, like in a power regulator. But a
	// zener can only do this smoothly if it passes a large enough
	// current. This is especially true for "zeners" of voltages of 9.1
	// volts or more, which properly speaking are "avalanche diodes" that
	// don't user the actual Zener effect but rather a different effect,
	// avalanche breakdown, which is capable of generating far more noise.
	// Standard zener specifications include "knee" figures which in
	// effect give the minimum expected current, along with the maximum
	// "dynamic impedance" at that current: how much the voltage may vary
	// if the current changes, or vice versa. For the 1N5239, the knee is
	// at 250 microamps, and the maximum dynamic impedance at the knee is
	// 600 ohms, so a 1 microamp increase in current at that point would
	// raise the voltage drop by up to 0.6 millivolts. Noise values for
	// zeners are often not given at all, or if they are (as with
	// Motorola's zeners), they are given at the knee current. In short,
	// the manufacturer expects the current to be kept above the knee
	// value, and if your current is lower, you're on your own.
	//
	// At very low currents, still within the breakdown region but well
	// below the knee current, the zener's dynamic impedance is much
	// greater, and more importantly, so is its noise. The conduction of
	// current is no longer smooth and regular, but pulsing and episodic,
	// as small conducting "microplasmas" within the diode's junction are
	// repeatedly triggered and extinguished, like microscopic versions of
	// lightning bolts in a thunderstorm.
	//
	// The netlist library includes a Zener diode model, but this model
	// does not simulate the Zener's noise behavior. Instead I generate
	// the noise from a noise voltage source in series with the Zener.

	// Simple model of a 1N5239 9.1-volt Zener diode. The 1N5239 is
	// specified to conduct 20 mA of current at its nominal breakdown
	// voltage of 9.1 V. The model produces an exponential I-V curve,
	// passing through this point, which has the same general shape as
	// that of a normal forward-biased diode. NBV is an exponent scale
	// factor; its value here of 1 gives the curve a steep rise and a
	// relatively sharp knee. Actual breakdown I-V curves have an even
	// steeper rise and sharper knee, too steep and sharp to be
	// represented by an exponential, but this model is good enough for

	// More explanation is needed for the "shot" sounds. Apart from their
	// higher frequency and faster decay, the "ka-pow" effect in their
	// initial attack further distinguishes them from the "hit" sounds.
	// This effect comes from the high current gain (around 450-500) of
	// the amplifier's A-138 transistor together with the low emitter
	// resistance. When the current supply for the sound is switched on,
	// the collector voltage at first spikes upward as the supply
	// capacitor is charged. But the transistor's base voltage and base
	// current also rise, which "turns on" the transistor, and as its
	// collector current increases through its biasing resistor, the
	// collector voltage plummets. For the "shot" sound transistors,
	// because of their high current gain and low emitter resistance, the
	// collector current grows so much that the collector voltage is
	// pulled below the base voltage, pushing the transistor into
	// saturation. This persists for as long as the current supply switch
	// remains on; the collector voltage stays low with little variation.
	// In this state the amplifier's input noise signal is being clipped
	// rather than amplified.

	// The result is that the sound effect's initial voltage spike is
	// followed by a relatively prolonged low with almost no noise. As
	// this signal passes through the output coupling capacitor, the
	// intervening filter and potentiometer, and then the second
	// amplification stage, it becomes a series of strong oscillations,
	// followed by a momentary silence which lasts as long as the sound's
	// switch is held on: around 50 milliseconds.

	// Finally the sound switch is turned off, and the amplifier's supply
	// voltage and current begin to drop as the supply capacitor
	// discharges. The base current and collector current drop also, and
	// the collector voltage begins to rise, eventually rising above the
	// base voltage again. The transistor leaves saturation and returns to
	// forward active mode. Now the noise signal is not being clipped but
	// gets properly amplified on the collector output. So the momentary
	// silence is followed by a sudden burst of noise, which then dies
	// away as the supply capacitor is drained.

	// The result is the shot's distinct "ka-pow" sound: an initial
	// punctuating crack, a very brief silence, and a sudden noise burst
	// that quickly fades.

	// The "hit" sounds don't have this effect, despite using the same
	// high-gain transistors, because their transistor amplifiers have a
	// bypass capacitor and a much larger emitter resistance, 1 Kohm
	// versus 100 ohms. That higher resistance keeps the collector current
	// low enough that the collector voltage never drops below the base
	// voltage, so the transistor never saturates, while the bypass
	// capacitor allows the amplifier's AC gain to remain very high.
