#F256K on MAME Instructions
Place the executable in a desired folder.
Create a sub-folder named "roms" and place the f256k.zip file in it, without decompressing.

Open a terminal window, such as "cmd" on Windows or bash in Linux.

For help, type `./f256 -h`.  On Windows, type `.\f256.exe -h`.
For usage info, type `./f256 -showusage`.  On Windows, type `.\f256.exe -showusage`.
To run in fullscreen mode, type `./f256 f256k`.  On Windows, type `.\f256.exe f256k`.

To use the provided SD card image, add ` -harddisk sdcard.img` with the appropriate filename, of course.

To run in "windowed" mode, add ` -window -resolution 800x600` to get a resolution of 800 by 600.

You will have to study the MAME key codes to see how to get debugging going (backtick `` is the default).

You can turn off sound by adding ` -sound none` to the command.
