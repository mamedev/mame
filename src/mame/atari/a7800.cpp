  a7800.c

  Driver file to handle emulation of the Atari 7800.

  Dan Boris

    2002/05/13 kubecj   added more banks for bankswitching
                        added PAL machine description
                        changed clock to be precise
                        improved cart emulation (in machine/)

    2012/10/25 Robert Tuccitto  NTSC Color Generator utilized for
                color palette with hue shift/start
                based on observation of several
                systems across multiple displays

    2012/11/09 Robert Tuccitto  Fixed 3 degree hue begin point
                miscalculation of color palette

    2012/12/05 Robert Tuccitto  Implemented proper IRE and phase
               value to the palette

    2012/12/14 Robert Tuccitto  Adjusted colorburst/tint/hue of entire
               palette to closer reflect default hardware configuration
               setting of ~180 degrees.  Palette settings now correspond
               documented and calculated settings as follows:

               Contrast = 0.0526 --> 0.05
               Brightness = 0.0 --> 0.00
               Color = 0.2162 --> 0.22
               Phase = 25.714 --> 25.7
               Colorburst/Hue = 180 degrees

    2013/02/27 Robert Tuccitto  Palette rebuild due to misaligned
               data references.  Corrected PAL color sequence order.

    2013/03/19 Robert Tuccitto  Stripped palette to raw video output
               values removing YIQ/YUV infer data.

    2013/04/02 Robert Tuccitto  Corrected rotation values and errors
               including duplicate entries for palette.

    2013/04/07 Robert Tuccitto  Address map locations for the XBOARD
               added.

    2013/05/01 Robert Tuccitto  Red and Blue miscalculated proportions
               fixed.

    2013/08/04 Robert Tuccitto  Green miscalculated proportions fixed.

    2013/08/13 Robert Tuccitto  Normalized contrast and brightness,
               providing a standardize grayscale and adjusted color values.

    2013/09/02 Robert Tuccitto  Stored data for 26.7 & 27.7 phase shifts
               with corrections and label for 25.7 values. Made 26.7
               (medium) default. Phase shifting falls outside the realm of
               video controls and hope to implement a selectable toggle
               hardware option similar to Donkey Kong TKG02/TKG04.

    2013/09/19 Robert Tuccitto  Cleanup of Address Maps, high score maps
               added.

    2013/10/16 Robert Tuccitto  Added Phase Shifts 24.7, 25.2, 26.2, 27.2.
               Phase Shifts 24.7 through 27.7 degrees with 0.5 degree
               increments documented. Phase Shift 26.2 degrees made active.
               Fixed typo under 26.7 7$.

    2013/10/27 Robert Tuccitto  Modernized screen parameters for NTSC & PAL.

    2013/11/03 Robert Tuccitto  Fixed correctly typo under 26.7 7$.

    2013/11/23 Robert Tuccitto  Added NTSC Palette Notes.

    2014/01/02 Robert Tuccitto  Corrected joystick buttons assignment & minor
                                palette notes cleanup.

    2014/01/09 Robert Tuccitto  Positional description for difficulty
                                switches added.

    2014/02/15 Robert Tuccitto  Added more details and clarification
                                regarding the potentiometer.

    2014/03/25 Mike Saarna  Fixed Riot Timer

    2014/04/04 Mike Saarna  Fix to controller button RIOT behavior

    2014/05/06 Mike Saarna/Robert Tuccitto Brought initial Maria cycle counts
               inline from measurements taken with logic analyzer and tests.

    2014/08/25 Fabio Priuli Converted carts to be slot devices and cleaned
               up the driver (removed the pokey, cleaned up rom regions, etc.)

/***************************************************************************
Atari 7800 NTSC Palette Notes:

Palette on a modern flat panel display (LCD, LED, Plasma, etc.) appears
different from a traditional CRT. The most outstanding difference is Hue 1x,
the hue begin point. Hue 1x looks very 'green' (~-60 to -45 degrees -
depending on how poor or well it handles the signal conversion and its
calibration) on a modern flat panel display, as opposed to 'gold' (~-33
degrees) on a CRT.

The potentiometer (pot adjustment) for the 7800 modifies the delay line
regarding colors it will exhibit and is extremely sensitive.  The slightest
turn can have a significant impact.

A system whose potentiometer is not properly calibrated via
'CPS 7800 Diagnostic Test Cartridge' or/and just slightly off from the
desired factory settings may exhibit consequences such as too much blue in
place of green (Pot adjusted slightly too far left) or washed out reddish
tones in place of where most other systems display a darker reddish tones
(Pot adjusted slightly too far right).

This is a result of the phase shifting of lesser degrees (Pot adjusted more
to the left) or phase shifting of greater degrees (Pot adjusted more to the
right).

Turning the pot adjustment to the right, it can be observed that the values
of the higher end of the scale will match the lower end of the scale.
For example, after some turning to the right, the values of Dx, Ex, Fx,
can be set to match 1x, 2x, 3x.

After further turning to the right, now the palette can be brought to make
Ax, Bx, Cx, Dx, Ex, Fx will match 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 6x.

Ultimately though, too much turning to the right results in all colors being
wiped from the scale, excluding the hue begin point 1x (Which remains
unchanged while tweaking the potentiometer either left or right).

Continuously turning the pot adjustment to the left, red and blue become the
most dominant two colors encompassing the palette with only a slight
influence of green at the highest end of the palette (Fx), once turned all
the way leftward.

The degree range for adjustment of the phase shifting on the 7800 appears
to be as low as approximately 15 degrees when tuned all the way left, and
seems to be able to achieve as high as approximately 45 degrees when turned
right before losing all color (Excluding 1x) from the palette scale.

For even a properly calibrated system at power on, the system's phase
shift appears as low as ~23 degrees and after a considerable consistent
runtime ('warm-up'), can be as high as ~28 degrees.

In general, the low end of ~23 degrees lasts for maybe several seconds,
whereas higher values such as ~25-27 degrees is the most dominant during
system run time.  180 degrees colorburst takes place at ~25.7 degrees (A
near exact match of Hue 1x and 15x - To the naked eye they appear to be
the same).

However, consistent system run time causes Hue 15x (F$) to become
stronger/darker gold (More brown then ultimately red-brown); as well
as leans Hue 14x (E$) more brown than green.  Once achieving a phase shift
of 27.7, Hue 14x (E$) and Hue 15x (F$) near-exact match Hue 1x and 2x
respectively.

Therefore, an ideal phase shift while accounting for the reality of
shifting while warming up, as well as maintaining differences between 1x,
2x and 14x, 15x, would likely fall between a 25.7 and 27.7. Phase shifts
26.2 degrees and 26.7 degrees places Hue 15x (F$) between Hue 1x and
Hue 2x, having 26.2 degrees leaning closer to Hue 1x and 26.7 degrees
leaning closer to Hue 2x.

The above notion would also harmonize with what has been documented for
the colors of 1x, 2x, 14x, 15x on the 7800.  1x = Gold, 2x = Orange,
14x (E$) = Orange-Green. 15x (F$) = Light Orange.  Color descriptions are
best measured in the middle of the brightness scale.  It should be
mentioned that Green-Yellow is referenced at Hue 13x (D$), nowhere near
Hue 1x.  A Green-Yellow Hue 1x is how the palette is manipulated and
modified (in part) under a modern flat panel display.

Additionally, the blue to red (And consequently blue to green) ratio
proportions may appear different on a modern flat panel display than a CRT
in some instances for the Atari 7800 system.  Furthermore, you may have
some variation of proportions even within the same display type.

One side effect of this on the console's palette is that some values of
red may appear too pinkish - Too much blue to red.  This is not the same
as a traditional tint-hue control adjustment; rather, can be demonstrated
by changing the blue ratio values via MAME HLSL settings.

Lastly, the Atari 2600 & 5200 NTSC color palettes hold the same hue
structure order and have similar appearance differences that are dependent
upon display type.
