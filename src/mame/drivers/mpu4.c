/* Note 19/07/11 DH
 - added lots of sets

   these are mostly unsorted and need to be split into clones
   the original source of these was a mess, assume things to be mislabled, bad, duplicated, or otherwise
   badly organized.  a lot of work is needed to sort them out, especially the Barcrest sets!  Some of this
   stuff MIGHT be in the wrong driver, or missing roms (sound roms especially)

/***********************************************************************************************************
  Barcrest MPU4 highly preliminary driver by J.Wallace, and Anonymous.

  This is the core driver, no video specific stuff should go in here.
  This driver holds all the mechanical games.

     06-2011: Fixed boneheaded interface glitch that was causing samples to not be cancelled correctly.
              Added the ability to read each segment of an LED display separately, this may be necessary for some
              games that use them as surrogate lamp lines.
              New persistence 'hack' to stop light flicker for the small extender.
     05-2011: Add better OKI emulation
     04-2011: More accurate gamball code, fixed ROM banking (Project Amber), added BwB CHR simulator (Amber)
              This is still a hard coded system, but significantly different to Barcrest's version.
              Started adding support for the Crystal Gaming program card, and the link keys for setting parameters.
     03-2011: Lamp timing fixes, support for all known expansion cards added.
     01-2011: Adding the missing 'OKI' sound card, and documented it, but it needs a 6376 rewrite.
     09-2007: Haze: Added Deal 'Em video support.
  03-08-2007: J Wallace: Removed audio filter for now, since sound is more accurate without them.
                         Connect 4 now has the right sound.
  03-07-2007: J Wallace: Several major changes, including input relabelling, and system timer improvements.
     06-2007: Atari Ace, many cleanups and optimizations of I/O routines
  09-06-2007: J Wallace: Fixed 50Hz detection circuit.
  17-02-2007: J Wallace: Added Deal 'Em - still needs some work.
  10-02-2007: J Wallace: Improved input timing.
  30-01-2007: J Wallace: Characteriser rewritten to run the 'extra' data needed by some games.
  24-01-2007: J Wallace: With thanks to Canonman and HIGHWAYMAN/System 80, I was able to confirm a seemingly
              ghastly misuse of a PIA is actually on the real hardware. This fixes the meters.

--- Board Setup ---

The MPU4 BOARD is the driver board, originally designed to run Fruit Machines made by the Barcrest Group, but later
licensed to other firms as a general purpose unit (even some old Photo-Me booths used the unit).

This board uses a ~1.72 Mhz 6809B CPU, and a number of PIA6821 chips for multiplexing inputs and the like.

To some extent, the hardware feels like a revision of the MPU3 design, integrating into the base unit features that were
previously added through expansion ports. However, there is no backwards compatibility, and the entire memory map has been
reworked.

Like MPU3, a 6840PTM is used for internal timing, and other miscellaneous control functions, including as a crude analogue sound device
(a square wave from the PTM being used as the alarm sound generator). However, the main sound functionality is provided by
dedicated hardware (an AY8913).

A MPU4 GAME CARD (cartridge) plugs into the MPU4 board containing the game, and a protection PAL (the 'characteriser').
This PAL, as well as protecting the games, also controlled some of the lamp address matrix for many games, and acted as
an anti-tampering device which helped to prevent the hacking of certain titles in a manner which broke UK gaming laws.

Like MPU3, over the years developers have added more capabilities through the spare inputs and outputs provided. These provided
support for more reels, lamps and LEDs through daughtercards.
Several solutions were released depending on the manufacturer of the machine, all are emulated here.

In later revisions of the main board (MOD4 onwards), the AY8913 was removed entirely, as two official alternatives for sound had been produced.
In one, a YM2413 is built into the gameboard, and in the other an OKI MSM6376 is interfaced with a PIA and PTM to allow sophisticated
sampled sound.

The lamping and input handling side of the machine rely entirely on a column by column 'strobe' system, with lights and LEDs selected in turn.
In the inputs there are two orange connectors (sampled every 8ms) and two black ones (sampled every 16ms), giving 32 multiplexed inputs.

In addition there are two auxiliary ports that can be accessed separately to these and are bidirectional

TODO: - Distinguish door switches using manual
      - Complete stubs for hoppers (needs slightly better 68681 emulation, and new 'hoppers' device emulation)
      - It seems that the MPU4 core program relies on some degree of persistence when switching strobes and handling
      writes to the various hardware ports. This explains the occasional lamping/LED blackout and switching bugs
      For now, we're ignoring any extra writes to strobes, as the alternative is to assign a timer to *everything* and
      start modelling the individual hysteresis curves of filament lamps.
      - Fix BwB characteriser, need to be able to calculate stabiliser bytes. Anyone fancy reading 6809 source?
      - Strange bug in Andy's Great Escape - Mystery nudge sound effect is not played, mpu4 latches in silence instead (?)

The MOD 4 ROM cards are set up to handle 8 separate ROM pages, arranged as 2 sets of 4.

However, there is no evidence to suggest this was ever implemented.
The controls for it exist however, in the form of the Soundboard PIA CB2 pin, which is

        holes. When the low 4 bytes of AUX1 are triggered, this fires the ball out from the
        hole it's currently in, to land in another. Landing in the same hole causes the machine to
        refire the ball. The ball detection is done by the high 4 bytes of AUX1.
        Here we call the MAME RNG, once to pick a row, once to pick from the four pockets within it. We
        then trigger the switches corresponding to the correct number. This appears to be the best way

The MSM6376 sound chip is configured in a slightly strange way, to enable dynamic
sample rate changes (8Khz, 10.6 Khz, 16 KHz) by varying the clock.
According to the BwB programmer's guide, the formula is:
MSM6376 clock frequency:-
freq = (1720000/((t3L+1)(t3H+1)))*[(t3H(T3L+1)+1)/(2(t1+1))]
where [] means rounded up integer,
t3L is the LSB of Clock 3,
t3H is the MSB of Clock 3,
and t1 is the initial value in clock 1.

/*
Characteriser (CHR)

As built, the CHR is a PAL which can perform basic bit manipulation according to
an as yet unknown unique key. However, the programmers decided to best use this protection device in read/write/compare
cycles, storing almost the entire 'hidden' data table in the ROMs in plain sight. Only later rebuilds by BwB
avoided this 'feature' of the development kit, and will need a different setup.

This information has been used to generate the CHR tables loaded by the programs, until a key can be determined.

For most Barcrest games, the following method was used:

The initial 'PALTEST' routine as found in the Barcrest programs simply writes the first 'call' to the CHR space,
to read back the 'response'. There is no attempt to alter the order or anything else, just
a simple runthrough of the entire data table. The only 'catch' in this is to note that the CHR chip always scans
through the table starting at the last accessed data value, unless 00 is used to reset to the beginning. This is obviously
a simplification, in fact the PAL does bit manipulation with some latching.

However, a final 8 byte row, that controls the lamp matrix is not tested - to date, no-one outside of Barcrest knows
how this is generated, and currently trial and error is the only sensible method. It is noted that the default,
of all 00, is sometimes the correct answer, particularly in non-Barcrest use of the CHR chip, though when used normally,
there are again fixed call values.

/*
BwB Characteriser (CHR)

The BwB method of protection is considerably different to the Barcrest one, with any
incorrect behaviour manifesting in ridiculously large payouts. The hardware is the
same, however the main weakness of the software has been eliminated.

In fact, the software seems deliberately designed to mislead, but is (fortunately for
us) prone to similar weaknesses that allow a per game solution.

Project Amber performed a source analysis (available on request) which appears to make things work.
Said weaknesses (A Cheats Guide according to Project Amber)

The common initialisation sequence is "00 04 04 0C 0C 1C 14 2C 5C 2C"
                                        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
Using debug search for the first read from said string (best to find it first).

At this point, the X index on the CPU is at the magic number address.

The subsequent calls for each can be found based on the magic address

           (0) = ( (BWBMagicAddress))
           (1) = ( (BWBMagicAddress + 1))
           (2) = ( (BWBMagicAddress + 2))
           (3) = ( (BWBMagicAddress + 4))
           (4) = ( (BWBMagicAddress - 5))
           (5) = ( (BWBMagicAddress - 4))
           (6) = ( (BWBMagicAddress - 3))
           (7) = ( (BWBMagicAddress - 2))
           (8) = ( (BWBMagicAddress - 1))

These return the standard init sequence as above.

For ease of understanding, we use three tables, one holding the common responses
and two holding the appropriate call and response pairs for the two stages of operation
