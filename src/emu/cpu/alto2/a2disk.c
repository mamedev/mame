 *
 * A CLRSTAT starts the monoflop, and READY', i.e. the ready signal from the disk
 * drive, clears it. The Q' output is thus 0 for some time after CLRSTAT, and as
 * long as the disk signals being ready.
 *
 * If the disk is not ready, i.e. the Q' being 1, and if RDYLAT' - the READY' state
 * latched at the most recent CLRSTAT - is also 1, the ERRWAKE' signal will go 0.
 *
 * Each new sector (SECT[4]' going 1) will clock the FF 21a, which changes
 * its Q output depending on WAKEST' (K' is always 1):
 *   if J and K' are both 1, sets its Q to 1.
 *   if J is 0, and K' is 1, keeps Q as is.
 * So Q becomes 0 by WAKEST' going 0, and it becomes 1 with the next sector, if
 * WAKEST' is 1.
 *
 * The mono-flop to the right will generate a SECLATE signal, if WAKEST' was
 * not 0 when the disk signalled a new sector.
 *
 * The three J-K FFs at the bottom are all clocked with the rising edge of
 * SYSCLKB' (i.e falling edge of SYSCLKB).
 *
 * The left JK-FF propagates the current state of the upper JK-FF's Q output
 * to its own Q. The middle propagates the previous state of the left one,
 * and the JK-FF to the right delays the wandering Q for a third SYSCLKB'
 * rising edge, but only in one case:
 * 1)  if J and K' are both 1, set its Q to 1.
 * 2)  if J is 1, and K' is 0, toggle Q.
 * 3)  if J is 0, and K' is 1, keep Q as is.
 * 4)  if J and K' are both 0, set its Q to 0.
 *
 * The right FF's K' is 0 whenever the BLOCK signal (see DISK WORD TIMING)
 * and the sector task active signal (STSKACT) are 1 at the same time.
 *
 * Case 1) is the normal case, and it wakes the KSECT on the third SYSCLKB'
 * positive edge. It resets at that same time the left, middle, and upper
 * J-K FFs .
 *
 * Case 2) is due, when the sector task is already active the moment
 * the BLOCK signal arrives. This toggles the output, i.e. removes the
 * wake.
 *
 * Case 3) is for an active sector task without a new sector.
 *
 * And finally case 4) happens when an active sector task sees no new
 * sector, and BLOCK rises.
 *
 * (This is like the video timing's dwt_blocks and dht_blocks signals)

 * If SECLATE is 0, WDDONE' never goes low (counter's clear has precedence).
 *
 * If SECLATE is 1, WDDONE', the counter will count:
 *
 * If HIORDBIT is 1 at the falling edge of BITCLK, it sets the J-K flip-flop 67b, and
 * thus takes away the LOAD' assertion from the counter. It has been loaded with
 * 15, so it counts to 16 on the next rising edge and makes WDDONE' go to 0.
 *
 * If HIORDBIT is 0 at the falling edge of BITCLK, counting continues as it was
 * preset with BUS[4] at the last KCOM← load:
 *
 * If BUS[4] was 1, both J and K' of the FF (74109) will be 1 at the rising edge
 * of LDCOM' (at the end of KCOM←) and Q will be 1 => LOAD' is deasserted.
 *
 * If BUS[4] was 0, both J and K' will be 0, and Q will be 0 => LOAD' asserted.
 *
 * WDDONE' going from 0 to 1 will make the Q output of FF 43b go to 1.
 * The FF is also set, as long as OK TO RUN is 0.
 *
 * The FF 53a is clocked with falling edge of SYSCLKB (rising of SYSCLKB'),
 * and will:
 *   if J and K' are both 1, set its Q to 1.
 *   if J is 1, and K' is 0, toggle Q.
 *   if J is 0, and K' is 1, keep Q as is.
 *   if J and K' are both 0, set its Q to 0.
 * J is = Q of the FF 43b.
 * K is = 0, if both BLOCK and WDTASKACT are 1, and 1 otherwise.
 *
 * The FF 43a is clocked with falling edge of SYSCLKA (rising of SYSCLKA').
 * Its J and K' inputs are the Q output of the previous (middle) FF, thus
 * it will propagate the middle FF's Q to its own Q when SYSCLKA goes 0.
 *
 * If Q (53a) and Q (43a) are both 1, the WAKEKWDT' is 0 and the
 * word task wakeup signal is sent.
 *
 * WDALLOW going 0 asynchronously resets the 53a and 43a FFs, and thus
 * deasserts the WAKEKWD'. It also asynchronously sets the FF 53b, and
 * its output Q is the WDINIT signal.
 *
 * WDINIT is also deasserted with SYSCLKB going high, whenever both BLOCK
 * and WDTSKACT are 1.
 *
 * Whoa there! :-)
