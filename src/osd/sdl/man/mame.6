.\" DESCRIPTION chapter
.SH DESCRIPTION
Started in 1997 by Nicola Salmoria, MAME was originally intended as a series
of emulators for individual games, which were later combined into a single
multi\-game emulator. In the following years, MAME grew over and over up to
the actual size, with more than 100 contributors to the project.

.\" *******************************************************
.SS Configuration options
.\" *******************************************************
.TP
.B \-[no]readconfig, \-[no]rc
Enables or disables the reading of the config files. When enabled
(which is the default), MAME reads the following config files in order:
.br
1. \fBmame.ini\fR
.br
the main configuration file
.br
2. \fIname\fB.ini\fR
.br
where \fIname\fR is your executable name, i.e. mame unless you changed it
(e.g. if you renamed mame to mame0137, the parsed file will be
\fImame0137.ini\fR)
.br
3. \fBdebug.ini\fR, if the debugger is enabled
.br
4. \fBvector.ini\fR, for vector games only
.br
5. \fI[driver]\fB.ini\fR
.br
based on the source filename of the game driver
.br
6. \fI[parent]\fB.ini\fR
.br
for clones only, may be called recursively
.br
7. \fI[gamename]\fB.ini\fR
.br
note this sometimes resolves to the same of the source driver
.br
The settings in the later ini's override those in the earlier ini's.
So, for example, if you wanted to disable overlay effects in the
vector games, you can create a vector.ini with the "effect none" line
in it, and it will override whatever effect value you have in your
mame.ini. The default is ON (\-readconfig).
.TP
.B \-[no]writeconfig, \-[no]wc
Write configuration to \fI[driver]\fR.ini on exit.
Default is OFF (\-nowriteconfig).
.\"
.\" *******************************************************
.SS Search path options
.\" *******************************************************
Be careful to use the path, directory and file options in
mame.ini \fBONLY\fR. Otherwise, the outcome may be unpredictable and not
consistent across releases.
.TP
.B \-rompath, \-rp, \-biospath, \-bp \fIpathname

Specifies a list of paths within which to find crosshair files. Multiple
paths can be specified by separating them with semicolons. The default
is 'crosshair' (that is, a directory "crosshair" in the same directory as
the MAME executable).  If the Crosshair is set to default in the menu,
MAME will look for gamename\cross#.png and then cross#.png in the
specified crosshairpath, where # is the player number.  Failing that,
MAME will use built\-in default crosshairs.
.\"
.\" *******************************************************
.SS Output Directory Options
.\" *******************************************************
.TP
.B \-cfg_directory \fIpathname
Specifies a single directory where configuration files are stored.
Configuration files store user configurable settings that are read at
startup and written when MAME exits. The default is 'cfg' (that is,
a directory "cfg" in the same directory as the MAME executable). If this
directory does not exist, it will be automatically created.
.TP
.B \-nvram_directory \fIpathname
Specifies a single directory where NVRAM files are stored. NVRAM files
store the contents of EEPROM and non\-volatile RAM (NVRAM) for games
which used this type of hardware. This data is read at startup and
written when MAME exits. The default is 'nvram' (that is, a directory
"nvram" in the same directory as the MAME executable). If this directory
does not exist, it will be automatically created.
.TP
.B \-input_directory \fIpathname
Specifies a single directory where input recording files are stored.
Input recordings are created via the \-record option and played back via
the \-playback option. The default is 'inp' (that is, a directory
"inp" in the same directory as the MAME executable). If this directory
does not exist, it will be automatically created.
.TP
.B \-state_directory \fIpathname
Specifies a single directory where save state files are stored. Save
state files are read and written either upon user request, or when using
the \-autosave option. The default is 'sta' (that is, a directory "sta"
in the same directory as the MAME executable). If this directory does
not exist, it will be automatically created.
.TP
.B \-snapshot_directory \fIpathname
Specifies a single directory where screen snapshots are stored, when
requested by the user. The default is 'snap' (that is, a directory
"snap" in the same directory as the MAME executable). If this directory
does not exist, it will be automatically created.
.TP
.B \-diff_directory \fIpathname
Specifies a single directory where hard drive differencing files are
stored. Hard drive differencing files store any data that is written
back to a hard disk image, in order to preserve the original image. The
differencing files are created at startup when a game with a hard disk
image. The default is 'diff' (that is, a directory "diff" in the same
directory as the MAME executable). If this directory does not exist,
it will be automatically created.
.TP
.B \-comment_directory \fIpathname
Specifies a single directory where debugger comment files are stored.
Debugger comment files are written by the debugger when comments are
added to the disassembly for a game. The default is 'comments' (that is,
a directory "comments" in the same directory as the MAME executable).
If this directory does not exist, it will be automatically created.
.\"
.\" *******************************************************
.SS State/playback options
.\" *******************************************************
.TP
.B \-state \fIslot
Immediately after starting the specified game, will cause the save
state in the specified \fIslot\fP to be loaded.
.TP
.B \-[no]autosave
When enabled, automatically creates a save state file when exiting MAME
and automatically attempts to reload it when later starting MAME with
the same game. This only works for games that have explicitly enabled
save state support in their driver. The default is OFF (\-noautosave).
.TP
.B \-playback, \-pb \fIfilename
Specifies a file from which to play back a series of game inputs. This
feature does not work reliably for all games, but can be used to watch
a previously recorded game session from start to finish. In order to
make things consistent, you should only record and playback with all
configuration (.cfg), NVRAM (.nv), and memory card files deleted. The
default is NULL (no playback).
.TP
.B \-record, \-rec \fIfilename
Specifies a file to record all input from a game session. This can be
used to record a game session for later playback. This feature does not
work reliably for all games, but can be used to watch a previously
recorded game session from start to finish. In order to make things
consistent, you should only record and playback with all configuration
(.cfg), NVRAM (.nv), and memory card files deleted. The default is NULL
(no recording).
.TP
.B \-mngwrite \fIfilename
Writes each video frame to the given \fIfilename\fP in MNG format, producing
an animation of the	game session. Note that \-mngwrite only writes video
frames; it does not save any audio data. Use \-wavwrite for that, and
reassemble the audio/video using offline tools. The default is NULL (no
recording).
.TP
.B \-aviwrite \fIfilename
Stream video and sound data to the given \fIfilename\fP in AVI format,
producing an animation of the game session complete with sound. The
default is NULL (no recording).
.TP
.B \-wavwrite \fIfilename
Writes the final mixer output to the given \fIfilename\fP in WAV format,
producing an audio recording of the	game session. The default is NULL
(no recording).
.TP
.B \-snapname \fIstring
Describes how MAME should name files for snapshots. \fIstring\fP
provides a template that is used to generate a filename. Three
simple substitutions are provided: the / character represents the
path separator on any target platform (even Windows); the literal \fB%g\fP
represents the driver name of the current game; and the literal \fB%i\fP
represents an incrementing index. If \fB%i\fP is omitted, then each
snapshot taken will overwrite the previous one; otherwise, MAME will
find the next empty value for \fB%i\fP and use that for a filename. The
default is \fB%g/%i\fP, which creates a separate folder for each game,
and names the snapshots under it starting with 0000 and increasing
from there. Example: if you use
.B mame robby \-snapname foo/%g%i
snapshots will be saved as \fBsnaps/foo/robby0000.png\fP,
\fBsnaps/foo/robby0001.png\fP and so on.
.TP
.B \-snapsize \fIwidth\fPx\fIheight
Hard\-codes the size for snapshots and movie recording. By default,
MAME will create snapshots at the game's current resolution in raw
pixels, and will create movies at the game's starting resolution in
raw pixels. If you specify this option, then MAME will create both
snapshots and movies at the size specified, and will bilinear filter
the result. Note that this size does not automatically rotate if the 
game is vertically oriented. The default is 'auto'.
.TP
.B \-snapview internal\fR|\fBauto\fR|\fIviewname
Specifies the view to use when rendering snapshots and movies. By
default, both use a special 'internal' view, which renders a separate
snapshot per screen or renders movies only of the first screen. By
specifying this option, you can override this default behavior and
select a single view that will apply to all snapshots and movies.
Note that \fIviewname\fP does not need to be a perfect match; rather, it
will select the first view whose name matches all the characters
specified by \fIviewname\fP. For example, \-snapview native will match the 
"Native (15:14)" view even though it is not a perfect match. 
\fIviewname\fP can also be 'auto', which selects the first view with all
screens present. The default value is 'internal'.
.TP
.B \-[no]snapbilinear
Specify whether snapshot/movie should have bilinear filtering applied.
Default is ON (\-snapbilinear).
.TP
.B \-statename \fIstring
Describes how MAME should store save state files, relative to the
state_directory path. \fIstring\fP provides a template that
is used to generate a relative path. Two simple substitutions are
provided: the / character represents the path separator on any target
platform (even Windows); the literal \fB%g\fP represents the driver name of
the current game. The default is '%g', which creates a separate folder
for each game. Example: if you use
.B mame robby \-statename foo/%g
save states will be stored inside \fBsta/foo/robby/\fP. 
.TP
.B \-[no]burnin
Tracks brightness of the screen during play and at the end of 
emulation generates a PNG that can be used to simulate burn\-in
effects on other games. The resulting PNG is created such that the
least used\-areas of the screen are fully white (since burned\-in areas 
are darker, all other areas of the screen must be lightened a touch).
The intention is that this PNG can be loaded via an artwork file with
a low alpha (e.g, 0.1\-0.2 seems to work well) and blended over the
entire screen. The PNG files are saved in the snap directory under 
the gamename\\burnin\-<screen.name>.png. The default is OFF (\-noburnin).

.SS Performance options
.\" *******************************************************
.TP
.B \-[no]autoframeskip, \-[no]afs
Automatically determines the frameskip level while you're playing the
game, adjusting it constantly in a frantic attempt to keep the game
running at full speed. Turning this on overrides the value you have set
for \-frameskip below. The default is OFF (\-noautoframeskip).
.TP
.B \-frameskip, \-fs \fIvalue
Specifies the frameskip value (autoframeskip must be disabled). This is the
number of frames out of every 12 to drop when running. For example, if you
say \-frameskip 2, then MAME will display 10 out of every 12 frames. By
skipping those frames, you may be able to get full speed in a game that
requires more horsepower than your computer has. The default value is 0,
which skips no frames.
.TP
.B \-seconds_to_run, \-str \fIvalue
This option can be used for benchmarking and automated testing. It tells 
MAME to stop execution after a fixed number of seconds. By combining 
this with a fixed set of other command line options, you can set up a 
consistent environment for benchmarking MAME performance. In addition, 
upon exit, the \-str option will write a screenshot called final.png
to the game's snapshot directory.
.TP
.B \-[no]throttle
Configures the default thottling setting. When throttling is on, MAME
attempts to keep the game running at the game's intended speed. When
throttling is off, MAME runs the game as fast as it can. Note that the
fastest speed is more often than not limited by your graphics card,
especially for older games. The default is ON (\-throttle).
.TP
.B \-[no]sleep
Allows MAME to give time back to the system when running with \-throttle.
This allows other programs to have some CPU time, assuming that the
game isn't taxing 100% of your CPU resources. This option can potentially
cause hiccups in performance if other demanding programs are running.
The default is ON (\-sleep).
.TP
.B \-speed \fIvalue
Controls the speed of gameplay, relative to realtime; smaller numbers are
slower. Default is 1.00.
.TP
.B \-[no]refreshspeed, \-[no]rs
Automatically adjusts the \fB\-speed\fR parameter to keep the effective refresh
rate below that of the lowest screen refresh rate.
Default is OFF (\-norefreshspeed).

.\" *******************************************************
.TP
.B \-[no]rotate
Rotate the game to match its normal state (horizontal/vertical). This
ensures that both vertically and horizontally oriented games show up
correctly without the need to rotate your monitor. If you want to keep
the game displaying 'raw' on the screen the way it would have in the
arcade, turn this option OFF. The default is ON (\-rotate).
.TP
.B \-[no]ror | \-[no]rol
Rotate the game screen to the right (clockwise) or left (counter\-
clockwise) relative to either its normal state (if \-rotate is specified)
or its native state (if \-norotate is specified).
Default for both is OFF (\-noror \-norol).
.TP
.B \-[no]autoror | \-[no]autorol
These options are designed for use with pivoting screens that only
pivot in a single direction. If your screen only pivots clockwise,
use \-autorol to ensure that the game will fill the screen either
horizontally or vertically in one of the directions you can handle.
If your screen only pivots counter\-clockwise, use \-autoror.
Default for both is OFF (\-noautoror \-noautorol).
.TP
.B \-[no]flipx \-[no]flipy
Flip (mirror) the game screen either horizontally (\-flipx) or
vertically (\-flipy). The flips are applied after the \-rotate and

.B \-brightness \fIvalue
Controls the default brightness, or black level, of the game screens.
This option does not affect the artwork or other parts of the display.
Using the MAME UI, you can individually set the brightness for each game
screen; this option controls the initial value for all visible game
screens. The standard value is 1.0. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1)
will produce a darkened display, while selecting higher values (up to
2.0) will give a brighter display. The default is 1.0.
.TP
.B \-contrast \fIvalue
Controls the contrast, or white level, of the game screens. This option
does not affect the artwork or other parts of the display. Using the
MAME UI, you can individually set the contrast for each game screen;
this option controls the initial value for all visible game screens. The
standard value is 1.0. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will produce
a dimmer display, while selecting higher values (up to 2.0) will
give a more saturated display. The default is 1.0.
.TP
.B \-gamma \fIvalue
Controls the gamma, which produces a potentially nonlinear black to
white ramp, for the game screens. This option does not affect the
artwork or other parts of the display. Using the MAME UI, you can
individually set the gamma for each game screen; this option controls
the initial value for all visible game screens. The standard value is
1.0, which gives a linear ramp from black to white. Selecting lower
values (down to 0.1) will increase the nonlinearity toward black,
while selecting higher values (up to 3.0) will push the nonlinearity
toward white. The default is 1.0.
.TP
.B \-pause_brightness \fIvalue
This controls the brightness level when MAME is paused. The default

Default is SOFT.
.TP
.B \-[no]window, \-[no]w
Run MAME in either full screen or a window. This is a fully\-featured window
mode where the window resizes as necessary to track what the game does.
And you can resize it  yourself with your OS's standard window controls.
The default is OFF (\-nowindow).
.TP
.B \-[no]maximize, \-[no]max
Controls initial window size in windowed mode. If it is set on, the
window will initially be set to the maximum supported size when you
start MAME. If it is turned off, the window will start out at the
smallest supported size. This option only has an effect when the 
\-window option is used. The default is ON (\-maximize).
.TP
.B \-[no]keepaspect, \-[no]ka
Forces the correct aspect ratio. This means when you're resizing the window
in windowed mode the actual game image will resize in discrete steps to
maintain the proper shape of the game graphics. If you turn this off you can
resize the window to anything you like and get funny squishing and stretching.
The same applies for full\-screen. Default is ON (\-keepaspect).
.TP
.B \-[no]unevenstretch, \-[no]ues
Allow non\-integer stretch factors. Video purists should stay far, far away
from this option, while everyone else will be happy to know that it lets you
fill the screen properly in full\-screen mode. Default is ON (\-unevenstretch).

Enables simulation of the "coin lockout" feature that is implmeneted
on a number of game PCBs. It was up to the operator whether or not
the coin lockout outputs were actually connected to the coin
mechanisms. If this feature is enabled, then attempts to enter a coin
while the lockout is active will fail and will display a popup message
in the user interface. If this feature is disabled, the coin lockout
signal will be ignored. The default is ON (\-coin_lockout).
.TP
.B \-ctrlr \fIcontroller
Enables support for special controllers. Configuration files are
loaded from the ctrlrpath. They are in the same format as the .cfg
files that are saved, but only control configuration data is read
from the file. The default is NULL (no controller file).
.TP
.B \-[no]mouse
Controls whether or not MAME looks for a mouse controller to use. Note
that in many cases, lightguns are treated as mice by the operating
system, so you may need to enable this to enable lightgun support. When
this is enabled, you will not be able to use your mouse while playing
a game. If you want to get control of your computer back, you will need
to either pause the game or quit. The default is OFF (\-nomouse).
.TP
.B \-[no]joystick, \-[no]joy
Controls whether or not MAME looks for joystick/gamepad controllers.
The default is ON (\-joystick).
.TP
.B \-[no]lightgun, \-[no]gun
Controls whether or not MAME makes use of lightgun controllers.
Note that most lightguns map to the mouse, so using \-lightgun and
\-mouse together may produce strange results. The default is OFF
(\-nolightgun).
.TP
.B \-[no]multikeyboard, \-[no]multikey
Determines whether MAME differentiates between multiple keyboards.
Some systems may report more than one keyboard; by default, the data
from all of these keyboards is combined so that it looks like a single
keyboard. Turning this option on will enable MAME to report keypresses
on different keyboards independently. The default is OFF 
(\-nomultikeyboard).
.TP
.B \-[no]multimouse
Determines whether MAME differentiates between multiple mice. Some 
systems may report more than one mouse device; by default, the data
from all of these mice is combined so that it looks like a single
mouse. Turning this option on will enable MAME to report mouse 
movement and button presses on different mice independently. The 
default is OFF (\-nomultimouse).
.TP
.B \-[no]steadykey, \-[no]steady
Some games require two or more buttons to be pressed at exactly the
same time to make special moves. Due to limitations in the PC keyboard
hardware, it can be difficult or even impossible to accomplish that
using the standard keyboard handling. This option selects a different
handling that makes it easier to register simultaneous button presses,
but has the disadvantage of making controls less responsive. The
default is OFF (\-nosteadykey).
.TP
.B \-[no]ui_active
Enable MAME user interface on top of emulated keyboard (if present).
Default is OFF (\-noui_active).
.TP
.B \-[no]offscreen_reload, \-[no]reload
Controls whether or not MAME treats a second button input from a
lightgun as a reload signal. In this case, MAME will report the gun's
position as (0,MAX) with the trigger held, which is equivalent to an
offscreen reload. This is only needed for games that required you to 
shoot offscreen to reload, and then only if your gun does not support 
off screen reloads. The default is OFF (\-nooffscreen_reload).
.TP
.B \-joystick_map, \-joymap \fImap
Controls how joystick values map to digital joystick controls.
See /usr/share/doc/mame/config.txt for full details on \fImap\fR format.
.TP
.B \-joystick_deadzone, \-joy_deadzone, \-jdz \fIvalue
If you play with an analog joystick, the center can drift a little.
joystick_deadzone tells how far along an axis you must move before the
axis starts to change. This option expects a float in the range of
0.0 to 1.0. Where 0 is the center of the joystick and 1 is the outer
limit. The default is 0.3.
.TP
.B \-joystick_saturation, \-joy_saturation, \-jsat \fIvalue
If you play with an analog joystick, the ends can drift a little,
and may not match in the +/\- directions. joystick_saturation tells how 
far along an axis movement change will be accepted before it reaches 
the maximum range. This option expects a float in the range of 0.0 to 
1.0, where 0 is the center of the joystick and 1 is the outer limit.
The default is 0.85.
.TP
.B \-[no]natural, \-[no]nat
Allows user to specify whether or not to use a natural keyboard.
This allows you to start your game or system in a 'native' mode, depending
on your region, allowing compatibility for non\-"QWERTY" style keyboards.
The default is OFF (\-nonatural).
.TP
.B \-[no]joystick_contradictory, \-[no]joy_contradictory
Enable contradictory direction digital joystick input at the same time.
Default is OFF (\-nojoystick_contradictory).
.TP
.B \-coin_impulse \fItime
Set coin impulse time. A negative value for \fItime\fR disables the impulse;

.B \-joy_idx[0\-8] \fIjoystick
With these options you can assign a joystick to a 
specific index in MAME. Even if the kernel will list the joysticks
in a different order on the next boot, MAME will still see the joystick
as e.g. "Joystick 2". Use mame \-v to see which joysticks are recognized.
Default is 'auto'.

control for a particular game. For example, if you specify the option
\-paddle mouse, then any game that has a paddle control will automatically
enable mouse controls just as if you had explicitly specified \-mouse.
